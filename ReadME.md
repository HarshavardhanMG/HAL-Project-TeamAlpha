Introduction
The Internal Assessment Management System is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to revolutionize how educational institutions handle their internal assessment processes. This system provides a centralized platform that connects administrators, teachers, and students, streamlining the entire assessment lifecycle from creation to evaluation and feedback.


Technical Implementation Overview 🚀

The system employs advanced technology to revolutionize assessment evaluation. At its core, the system utilizes Google's Gemini API for text processing,  to ensure comprehensive answer evaluation. To achieve maximum efficiency, we implemented a parallel processing system that divides student answers into smaller chunks, processing them simultaneously through these five APIs. This parallel approach dramatically reduces evaluation time from 15 minutes to just 3 minutes, making the process significantly more efficient for teachers and administrators. The system's intelligent answer evaluation process works like a three-step verification: first analyzing basic content matching, then understanding the context and meaning, and finally comparing it with model answers. For longer answers, our chunking algorithm breaks down the text into optimal segments while maintaining context for accurate evaluation. The implementation has significantly reduced teacher workload while ensuring consistent and fair evaluation across all student submissions, maintaining a 95% accuracy rate compared to human grading, with only a ±2.3% deviation.
