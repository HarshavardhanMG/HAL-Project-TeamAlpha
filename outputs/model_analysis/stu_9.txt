question1 answer:
An algorithm is like a set of rules for solving a problem. It's like giving step by step instruction to computer to perform certain tasks.
Here are five important things:

Finiteness: Algorithm must stop after some time. It cant be a forever loop, it has to come to an end after some steps.

Definiteness: Every steps must be very clear. Computer needs precise instructions in order to perform correct steps.

Input: It can have input data on which it will process.

Output: It must give a result. The final output is what algorithm is for.

Effectiveness: Every step must be simple and easy to do. The steps must be realistic and doable.

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy() copies string to another variable.
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char a[20] = "hello";
char b[20];
strcpy(b,a);
printf("%s",b);
}


ii. strlen() gives the length of the string
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char a[20] = "hello";
int len = strlen(a);
printf("%d",len);
}


b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char name[50];
int i;
printf("enter name: ");
scanf("%s",name);
printf("ASCII values:\n");
for(i=0; i<strlen(name);i++)
{
printf("%c : %d\n",name[i],name[i]);
}
return 0;
}
