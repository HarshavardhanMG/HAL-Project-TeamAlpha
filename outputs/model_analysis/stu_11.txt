question1 answer:
An algorithm is a thing that tells computer how to do stuff. Its like recipe for computer and must be very clear.
Here are important things about algorithm

Finiteness: it should finish after sometime

Definiteness: It has to be clear instructions for computer

input: it needs some data to work with

output: it needs to provide a result

effectiveness: it should work

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy() copy string from one variable to another
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char a[] = "hello";
char b[10];
strcpy(b,a);
printf("%s",b);
}


ii. strlen() gives the length of string
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char a[] = "hello";
int l = strlen(a);
printf("%d",l);
}


b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char name[50];
    int i;
    printf("Enter name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);
    printf("ASCII Values are:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < strlen(name); i++) {
        printf("%c : %d\n", name[i], name[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
