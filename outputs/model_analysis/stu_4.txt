question1 answer:
An algorithm is a sequence of instructions designed to solve a particular problem. It's like a recipe, but for computers. It must be specific and follow certain rules.
The important characteristics of an algorithm are:

Finiteness: The algorithm must eventually stop. It can't run on and on without ever finishing, as this would be very bad for computers.

Definiteness: Each step should be clearly defined, so there's no confusion about what the computer should do at each point. There should be clear instructions that cannot be interpreted differently.

Input: Algorithms often need input to work. This could be a variety of data that the computer will process and give results.

Output: There must be output once the algorithm finishes its job. This is the result of running algorithm. Without result there is no meaning for algorithm.

Effectiveness: All operations should be able to run by the machine. It canâ€™t be something that the computer can't execute. It should be simple and can be done in a reasonable amount of time.

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy() function is used to duplicate one string to another.
Syntax: strcpy(destination,source)

Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char a[] = "abc";
char b[20];
strcpy(b,a);
printf("%s",b);
return 0;
}
ii. strlen() is used to get the length of any string.
Syntax: strlen(string)

Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char a[] = "abcd";
int len = strlen(a);
printf("%d",len);
return 0;
}

b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char name[50];
int i;
printf("enter name: ");
scanf("%s", name);
printf("ASCII Values: \n");
for(i=0; i < strlen(name); i++) {
printf("%c : %d\n", name[i], name[i]);
}
return 0;
}
