question1 answer:
Algorithm is basically steps to do something. When we want to do something on computer we need to give it a step by step instruction. This set of instructions that is given to a computer is called Algorithm.
important thing about algorithm

Finiteness: means it need to finish, it cannot be forever process. It must give result after some time.

Definiteness: all the steps of the algorithm should be clear. It should be easy to understand for the computer. Computer needs clear instruction in order to work properly.

Input: algorithm can take inputs to work on it. Like when we add numbers in calculator we give inputs and algorithm will work on it and show results.

Output: it should produce some kind of results or output. If there is no result then there is no point of running the algorithm.

Effectiveness: Every step should be doable, otherwise it does not work.

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy() is a function that copies one string to another string.
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char a[20] = "hello";
char b[20];
strcpy(b,a);
printf("%s",b);
}


ii. strlen() is function that gives the length of the string.
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char a[20] = "hello";
int len = strlen(a);
printf("%d",len);
}


b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char n[50];
    int i;
    printf("enter name:");
    scanf("%s", n);
    printf("ASCII values:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < strlen(n); i++) {
        printf("%c : %d\n", n[i], n[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
