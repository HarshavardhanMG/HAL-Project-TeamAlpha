question1 answer:
An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem. Like a instruction manual for computers. It tells the computer what to do step by step.
Five things about an algorithm are:

Finiteness: It means the algorithm will end eventually, and not go on forever. If a computer keeps running forever, that would be a disaster. So, every algorithm must stop after a certain number of steps.

Definiteness: Each instruction should be simple and easy to understand. This makes sure that computer will perform in consistent way.

Input: The algorithm might take some data as input, this might be numbers, text or anything else.

Output: An algorithm will always give you some results. This is the main purpose of an algorithm.

Effectiveness: Every step in an algorithm should be executable, and can be done easily in a short amount of time. This will ensure that we can easily solve the problem that we are trying to solve.

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy(): This function copies a string to another string variable.
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char str1[] = "code";
char str2[20];
strcpy(str2, str1);
printf("%s", str2);
}


ii. strlen(): This function is to get the length of a string.
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char str1[] = "code";
int len = strlen(str1);
printf("%d", len);
}


b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char name[50];
int i;
printf("enter your name: ");
scanf("%s",name);
printf("ASCII values are: \n");
for(i=0;i<strlen(name);i++)
{
printf("%c : %d \n",name[i],name[i]);
}
return 0;
}
