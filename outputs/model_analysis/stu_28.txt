question1 answer:
Algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem. It's like a procedure. We use algorithms in computers to tell them what to do.

Five things that are important for an algorithm:

Finite: It has to stop. If it doesn't stop, it's not a good algorithm. Importance: So it gives an answer eventually.

Clear: Steps should be clear. No confusion. Importance: So computer understands and does it right.

Input: Can have input. Importance: To work with different data.

Output: Must give output. Importance: To get the answer.

Possible: Steps must be possible to do. Importance: So it can be done in real life.

question2 answer:
2a.
i. strcpy() - Copies string: Copies one string to another place.

Syntax:
strcpy(destination, source)

Example:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
main() {
char a[] = "apple";
char b[10];
strcpy(b, a);
printf(b);
}

Output:
apple

ii. strlen() - Length of string: Counts how many characters in string.

Syntax:
strlen(string)

Example:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
main() {
char s[] = "banana";
int l = strlen(s);
printf("Length = %d", l);
}

Output:
Length = 6

2b.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
  char name[20];
  printf("Enter name: ");
  scanf("%s", name);

  for (int i = 0; i < name.length(); i++) { // Note: incorrect way to get length
    printf("%c is %d\n", name[i], name[i]);
  }
  return 0;
}


Example Output:
Enter name: Leo
L is 76
e is 101
o is 111
Error during compilation because of name.length()
