question1 answer:
An algorithm is like a detailed plan on how to do something. It's a set of instructions that a computer can use to solve a problem.
Here are 5 important characteristics of an algorithm:

Finiteness: An algorithm should have a clear start and end. It should not just continue infinitely.

Definiteness: Every step in the algorithm must be well-defined and there should not be any vagueness. It has to be very clear, so that computer can follow it.

Input: Algorithm takes some input to process, this is very important for algorithm.

Output: Every algorithm must produce some kind of result or outcome.

Effectiveness: Every steps in algorithm should be simple and easily doable. It should not be very difficult.

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy(): copies a string to another string.
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char str1[20] = "test";
char str2[20];
strcpy(str2,str1);
printf("%s",str2);
}


ii. strlen(): gets string length.
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char str1[20] = "test";
int len = strlen(str1);
printf("%d",len);
}


b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
    char name[50];
    int i;
    printf("Enter name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);
    printf("ASCII values:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < strlen(name); i++) {
        printf("%c: %d\n", name[i], name[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
