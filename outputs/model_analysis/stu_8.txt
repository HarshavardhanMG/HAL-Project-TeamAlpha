question1 answer:
An algorithm is like a recipe, but for computers. It’s a set of instructions on how to complete a task. It must be detailed so the computer can follow it correctly.
Here are 5 things an algorithm must have:

It has to finish: it should not go on and on and on. The steps must end eventually.

Each step should be clear: there shouldn’t be any confusion in any of the steps of the algorithm. The instructions must be very clear and precise.

Algorithm might need input: An algorithm may or may not have input.

Algorithm has to give output: The output is the goal of the algorithm. Algorithm is designed to produce specific output.

Algorithm should be effective : All the steps of the algorithm must be easy to understand and doable by the computer.

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy(): copy one string to another string.
Example

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char a[] = "hello";
char b[10];
strcpy(b,a);
printf("%s",b);
}


ii. strlen(): get length of the string
Example

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char a[] = "hello";
int l = strlen(a);
printf("%d",l);
}


b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char name[50];
int i;
printf("Enter name : ");
scanf("%s",name);
printf("ASCII Values: \n");
for(i = 0; i< strlen(name);i++)
{
printf("%c: %d \n",name[i],name[i]);
}
return 0;
}
