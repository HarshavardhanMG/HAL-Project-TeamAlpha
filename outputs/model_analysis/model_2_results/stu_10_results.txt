## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm. List five important characteristics of an algorithm. Explain the importance of each characteristic.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 marks (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4 marks
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student's definition of an algorithm is too simplistic and lacks precision. It doesn't mention key aspects like well-defined instructions, finite set, problem-solving, or the need for structure. (1 mark awarded out of 2.5)
    * Characteristics:  While the student correctly identifies the five characteristics, the explanations are superficial and lack depth. The importance of each characteristic is not adequately explained. (0.5 marks awarded for each characteristic, totaling 2.5 out of 7.5).  The student needs to elaborate on how each characteristic contributes to the correctness and efficiency of an algorithm.  For example, for "Finiteness," the student should mention resource usage and the importance of avoiding infinite loops. For "Definiteness," they should explain how ambiguity can lead to incorrect results.


**Question 2a: Explain the following string handling functions with examples. i. strcpy() - syntax and example ii. strlen()- syntax and example**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 marks (2.5 for each function explanation)
* **Awarded Marks:** 3 marks
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()`: The student provided a correct code example but lacked a proper definition and formal syntax declaration. The code compiles and works correctly. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * `strlen()`: Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provided a correct code example but lacked a proper definition and formal syntax declaration.  The code compiles and works correctly. (1.5 marks awarded)


**Question 2b: Write a C program, which reads your name from the keyboard and outputs a list of ASCII codes, which represent your name.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 marks
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5 marks
* **Feedback:**
    * The student's program functions correctly and fulfills all requirements. It reads the name, iterates through it, and prints the ASCII values.
    * Minor Deduction (0.5 marks): The prompt "name please: " is not as clear as "Enter your name: ".  While functionally equivalent, clear prompts are important for user experience.  Also, using `fgets` instead of `scanf("%s", name)` would be safer to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 15
* **Marks Obtained:** 11.5
* **Percentage:** 76.67%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All responses could be confidently matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and C programming concepts. However, they need to improve their ability to provide detailed explanations and formal definitions. The code examples are generally correct, but they lack proper documentation and could benefit from improved user interface elements and security considerations.  The student should focus on understanding the "why" behind concepts, not just the "how."
