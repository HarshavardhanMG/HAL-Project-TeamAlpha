**Detailed Score Breakdown:**

**Question 1: Algorithm Definition and Characteristics**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
    * Definition: 1.5/2.5 (Definition lacks precision and completeness. Missing key terms like "finite set" and "well-defined instructions")
    * Finiteness: 1.5/1.5 
    * Definiteness: 1.5/1.5
    * Input: 1/1.5 (Explanation lacks detail on the purpose of input)
    * Output: 1/1.5 (Explanation lacks detail on the purpose of output)
    * Effectiveness: 0.5/1.5 (Used the word "doable" which is less precise than "feasible" and explanation lacks depth)  
* **Feedback:** The definition of the algorithm is too informal. While the characteristics are correctly identified, the explanations for Input, Output, and Effectiveness could be more detailed and use more precise language.  


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 3/5
    * `strcpy()` : 2/2.5 (Correct syntax and example, but missing formal definition)
    * `strlen()` : 1/2.5 (Incorrect example due to using `char` instead of `char[]` for string declaration. Syntax lacks the return type and `const` qualifier.)
* **Feedback:** The `strcpy()` explanation is good but lacks a formal definition. The `strlen()` example has a significant error in string declaration, and the syntax is incomplete.


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5/5
* **Feedback:** The program functions correctly and produces the desired output. It uses a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop, which is an acceptable alternative.  Slight deduction for not using `fgets` for safer input handling (potential buffer overflow with `scanf`).

**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 14 / 20
* **Percentage:** 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and their characteristics but needs to work on providing more precise and complete definitions. The student shows proficiency in basic C programming but needs to review string handling concepts, particularly the correct usage of `strlen()` and safer input methods.  The student should also focus on providing complete function definitions and using standard C library function prototypes accurately.
