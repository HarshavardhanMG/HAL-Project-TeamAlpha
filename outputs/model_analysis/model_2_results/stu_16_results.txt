## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics (10 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:** 
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified definition (1.5/2.5 marks).  Lacks the precision and formality of the reference answer. Missing key terms like "finite set," "well-defined instructions," and "solve a problem."
    * Characteristics: The student identified all five characteristics and correctly explained their importance (1.5 marks each). However, the explanations lack the technical vocabulary used in the answer key (e.g., "infinite loop," "unambiguous," "feasible").  

**Question 2a: String Handling Functions (5 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for strcpy + 2.5 for strlen)
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()` : The student provided a basic explanation and a working example (2/2.5 marks). However, the syntax provided is incomplete (missing data types and `const`). The example uses `void main()`, which is not standard practice (should be `int main()`).
    * `strlen()` : The student provided a basic explanation and a working example (1/2.5 marks). Similar to `strcpy()`, the syntax lacks data types and `const`.  `void main()` issue present here as well.  No definition of `size_t` was given.

**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program (5 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The student's program compiles and runs, but it contains a significant error in using `sizeof(myname)` in the loop condition. `sizeof` returns the size of the array (30 bytes), not the length of the entered string. This leads to printing garbage values beyond the entered name. (Deduct 2 marks).
    * The student added a null check (`if (myname[i] != '\0')`), which is good practice but doesn't fix the fundamental `sizeof` issue. (Award 1 mark for attempting to handle the null terminator).
    * The output format is slightly different from the example, but it conveys the required information (ASCII values). (Award 1 mark for correct output of ASCII values for the entered name).


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 15
* **Marks Obtained:** 11.5
* **Percentage:** 76.67%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All responses could be matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:**

* None.


**Areas where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** Lack of formal language and technical vocabulary in defining the algorithm and explaining its characteristics.
* **Question 2a:** Incomplete syntax for `strcpy()` and `strlen()`. Use of `void main()` instead of `int main()`.
* **Question 2b:** Incorrect use of `sizeof` to determine string length, leading to processing beyond the valid string data.  


**General Recommendations for the Student:**

* Review the formal definitions of key computer science concepts like algorithms.
* Pay close attention to syntax details when working with programming language functions.
* Understand the difference between `sizeof` and `strlen` and how to correctly determine string lengths in C.
* Practice using standard C coding conventions (e.g., `int main()`).  
* Focus on using more precise and technical language in explanations.
