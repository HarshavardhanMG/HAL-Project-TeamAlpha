## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct, albeit less formal, definition of an algorithm.  The explanations for each characteristic are generally correct but lack the precision and depth of the answer key. Specifically, the student's explanation of "Finiteness" focuses on the negative consequence rather than the core concept.  Similarly, the explanation for "Definiteness" lacks the emphasis on unambiguity.  "Input" and "Output" explanations are adequate. The explanation for "Effectiveness" correctly identifies feasibility but misses the aspect of simplicity.  Deducting 0.5 marks for each characteristic explanation lacking depth.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student correctly explains the function's purpose and provides a working example. However, the syntax provided is incomplete; it lacks the data types.  The `const` keyword for the source is missing. Deducting 0.5 marks for the incomplete syntax.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provides a correct explanation and example for `strlen()`. However, the syntax lacks the return type (`size_t`) and the `const` qualifier for the input string. Deducting 0.5 marks for the incomplete syntax.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of a name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It correctly reads the name, iterates through each character, and prints the corresponding ASCII value. No deductions necessary.



## Summary:

* **Total Score:** 22 / 25
* **Percentage:** 88%

## Flagged Responses for Manual Review:

* None.  All responses were clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


## Areas for Improvement in Student's Answers:

* **Precision in Definitions:** While the student understands the concepts, focusing on more formal and precise definitions, especially for theoretical concepts like algorithms, is crucial.
* **Complete Syntax:**  Emphasis on including complete function syntax (return types, parameter types, qualifiers) is necessary for demonstrating a thorough understanding.
* **Depth in Explanations:**  Encouraging the student to elaborate on their explanations, providing more detail and nuance, will strengthen their understanding and improve their scores.
