## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a simplified definition of an algorithm, missing the key aspects of "well-defined instructions" and problem-solving.  The definition lacks the precision of the answer key but captures the essence.  All characteristics are correctly identified and their importance explained adequately, although in a simplified manner.  Deducting 0.5 marks for the less precise definition and 0.5 for each simplified characteristic explanation (total 2.5 deduction).


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1
* **Feedback:** The student correctly identifies the function's purpose but provides an incorrect syntax and example. The assignment within the `strcpy` function call is wrong, leading to a compilation error. The student demonstrates a lack of understanding of how `strcpy` works.  1 mark awarded for correctly stating the purpose.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student correctly identifies the function's purpose and provides a working example. However, the syntax provided is incomplete, missing the data type declaration for the function and the `const` qualifier for the input string. Deducting 0.5 marks for the incomplete syntax.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:** The student's program compiles and runs but uses `sizeof(name_input)` instead of `strlen(name_input)` in the loop condition. This results in printing garbage values beyond the entered name.  While the core logic of printing ASCII values is correct, this error demonstrates a misunderstanding of string handling in C. No null termination check is performed which is a good practice. Deducting 1 mark for using `sizeof` and 1 mark for missing the null check.


## Summary:

* **Total Score:** 13.5 / 20
* **Percentage:** 67.5%

## Flagged Responses for Manual Review:

* None. All responses could be confidently matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


## Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:

* None.


## Areas where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:

* **Question 1:** Algorithm definition lacks precision.  Explanations of characteristics are overly simplified.
* **Question 2a(i):** Incorrect syntax and example for `strcpy()`.
* **Question 2a(ii):** Incomplete syntax for `strlen()`.
* **Question 2b:** Use of `sizeof` instead of `strlen` in the loop, leading to printing of garbage values. Missing null termination check in the loop.  


This detailed evaluation provides a comprehensive overview of the student's performance, highlighting strengths and weaknesses in their understanding of algorithms and string handling in C.  The specific feedback for each question offers valuable insights for the student to improve their knowledge and skills.
