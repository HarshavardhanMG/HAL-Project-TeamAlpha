**Evaluation of Student Answers:**

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified definition, lacking the precision and formality of the answer key. (1.5/2.5 marks awarded)
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation. (1.5/1.5 marks awarded)
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation. (1.5/1.5 marks awarded)
    * Input: Correct explanation with a relevant example. (1.5/1.5 marks awarded)
    * Output: Correct explanation. (1.5/1.5 marks awarded)
    * Effectiveness: Correct explanation, but could be more detailed by mentioning computational feasibility. (1.5/1.5 marks awarded)


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * Provided a correct basic explanation and a functional example.
    * Missing formal definition, syntax declaration, and explanation of the header files.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** 
    * Provided a correct basic explanation and a functional example.
    * Missing formal definition, syntax declaration (including return type), and explanation of the header files.  


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The program functions correctly and produces the desired output.
    * Minor deduction for not using a more robust input method (e.g., `fgets` instead of `scanf("%s", n);` to prevent potential buffer overflow).  `scanf` with `%s` will stop reading at the first whitespace, which might not capture the full name if it contains spaces.

**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the fundamental concepts of algorithms and string handling functions. The provided C program is functional. However, the answers lack the formal rigor and completeness expected at a higher academic level. The student should focus on providing more precise definitions, including proper syntax and header file declarations, and using safer input methods in C programming.  More detailed explanations of the characteristics of algorithms, going beyond basic descriptions, would also improve the answers.
