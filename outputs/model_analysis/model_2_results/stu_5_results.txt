## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: 1.5/2.5  The definition provided is too simplistic and lacks precision. It doesn't mention key aspects like well-defined instructions, finite set, problem-solving, etc.  
    * Finiteness: 1/1.5 The answer captures the essence but lacks the formal terminology of "terminating after a finite number of steps."
    * Definiteness: 1/1.5 The answer is acceptable but could be more precise by mentioning "unambiguous" instructions.
    * Input: 1.5/1.5 Correct.
    * Output: 1.5/1.5 Correct.
    * Effectiveness: 1.5/1.5  While the student uses simpler language, the core idea of feasibility and executability within a limited time is conveyed.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The code functions correctly, but lacks a proper explanation or definition of the function.  The syntax is missing and there are no comments explaining the code.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The code functions correctly, but lacks a proper explanation or definition of the function. The syntax is missing and there are no comments explaining the code.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The code is correct, efficient, and well-formatted. It correctly reads the name, iterates through each character, and prints the corresponding ASCII value.  Good use of `strlen` within the loop condition.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 15
* **Percentage:** 75%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None


**Detailed Feedback and Areas for Improvement:**

* **Question 1:** The student needs to improve their understanding of formal definitions and use precise terminology when describing algorithmic concepts. Encourage the student to refer to textbook definitions and practice explaining them in their own words.
* **Question 2a:** While the student demonstrates practical coding skills, they need to focus on theoretical understanding. Emphasize the importance of providing definitions, syntax, and explanations alongside code examples. Encourage the student to explain the purpose and functionality of each function clearly.  Adding comments to the code would improve readability and demonstrate understanding.


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions in C.  Their practical coding skills are evident in the correct implementation of the ASCII value program. However, they need to improve their theoretical understanding, especially in providing formal definitions and explanations.  Encouraging the student to focus on clarity, precision, and comprehensive explanations will significantly enhance their performance.
