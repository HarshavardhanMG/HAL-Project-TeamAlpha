## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** 
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2/2.5 marks). More formal language and the mention of problem-solving would improve the answer.
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Input: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Output: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: The student's explanation focuses on simplicity and ease, but misses the crucial aspect of feasibility and executability within a limited time. (1/1.5 marks).  The term "realistic" is subjective and not as precise as "feasible."


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() Function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a correct basic example demonstrating the functionality of `strcpy()`. However, the answer lacks a formal definition and the explicit syntax of the function.  Missing crucial elements for a complete answer.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() Function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** 
    * Similar to `strcpy()`, the student demonstrated the use of `strlen()` correctly. However, a formal definition and the function's syntax are missing. Missing crucial elements for a complete answer.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student's C program is correct, well-structured, and produces the expected output.  No errors and good use of `strlen()` within the loop.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 17
* **Percentage:** 85%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be confidently matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic programming concepts and algorithms. However, the answers lack formal definitions and detailed explanations in some cases.  Focusing on precise language, including syntax and formal definitions, would significantly improve the quality of the answers.  The student should review the difference between "easy" and "feasible" in the context of algorithm design.  The programming skills demonstrated in 2b are commendable.
