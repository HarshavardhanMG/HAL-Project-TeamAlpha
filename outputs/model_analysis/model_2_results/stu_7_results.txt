**Evaluation Report**

**Question 1: Algorithm Definition and Characteristics**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2.5 marks awarded).  Could have been more formal.
    * Finiteness: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Input: Correctly explained the necessity of input but lacked the mention of "zero or more" (1 mark awarded).
    * Output: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: The explanation is a bit simplistic. While "easily doable" conveys the idea, using terms like "feasible" and relating it to computational complexity would have been better (1 mark awarded).  


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()`: The student provided a correct but minimal explanation and a working example. Missing a formal definition and the explicit mention of the null terminator being copied (1.5 marks awarded). Syntax is missing.
    * `strlen()`:  The student provided a correct but minimal explanation and a working example. Missing a formal definition and explanation of the return type `size_t` (1.5 marks awarded). Syntax is missing.


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a fully functional and correct C program that accurately reads a name and prints the ASCII values of each character.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 15.5
* **Percentage:** 77.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None


**Detailed Feedback and Areas for Improvement:**

* **Question 1:** While the student understands the basic concepts of algorithms, encouraging the use of more formal language and precise definitions would improve the answer.  The student should be encouraged to provide more comprehensive explanations, especially for characteristics like "Effectiveness," connecting it to feasibility and computational resources.
* **Question 2a:**  The student needs to pay more attention to detail when explaining functions. Including formal definitions, syntax, mentioning crucial details like the null terminator in `strcpy()`, and explaining return types are important for demonstrating a thorough understanding.  Examples, while correct, could be more robust with error handling (e.g., checking for buffer overflow in strcpy).


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic programming concepts and algorithms. However, there's room for improvement in providing more complete and formal explanations, especially when dealing with function definitions and algorithmic characteristics.  The student should focus on precision and detail in their answers.
