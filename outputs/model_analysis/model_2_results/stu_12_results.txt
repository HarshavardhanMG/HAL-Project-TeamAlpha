## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and important elements like "well-defined instructions" and the goal of "solving a problem."  While the essence is captured, a more formal definition is expected.
    * Finiteness: Correct (1.5/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct (1.5/1.5).
    * Input: Correct (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Partially correct (0/1.5). The student's answer is too simplistic.  It needs to emphasize the feasibility and executability of each step within a reasonable timeframe.  "Doable" is not a precise enough term.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provides a correct code example but lacks a proper definition and explanation of the function's purpose. The syntax is missing.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**  The student provides a correct code example but lacks a proper definition and explanation of the function's purpose. The syntax is missing.  The explanation of excluding the null character is crucial.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The program is functionally correct and produces the desired output. However, using "scanf("%s", name);" without specifying a field width is a security vulnerability (potential buffer overflow).  A minor deduction for not adhering to best practices.  Suggest using "scanf("%49s", name);" to limit input to the array size.  Also, "give name" is not grammatically correct; "Enter your name" is preferred.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 14.0
* **Percentage:** 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions in C.  However, the answers lack depth and precision, especially in definitions and explanations.  The student needs to focus on providing more complete and formally correct answers.  While the coding skills are evident, attention to detail and secure coding practices are necessary for improvement.  The student should review the formal definitions of algorithms and string functions, paying close attention to the nuances of each characteristic and function parameter.
