## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and important elements like "well-defined instructions" and the goal of "solving a problem."  It's too simplistic.
    * Finiteness: Correct understanding and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct understanding and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Input: Correct understanding and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct understanding and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Partially correct (0/1.5). The student used "Possible" instead of "Effectiveness." While related, "possible" doesn't capture the nuance of efficiency and feasibility in a limited time.  The explanation is also weak.  


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Overly simplified. Missing details about null termination and potential buffer overflow.
    * Syntax: Incorrect. Missing data types and `const` qualifier.
    * Example: Functionally correct, but lacks `return 0` in `main` and doesn't print using `%s` format specifier.  Missing good coding practices.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Acceptable.
    * Syntax: Incorrect. Missing data type and `const` qualifier.
    * Example: Functionally correct but lacks `return 0` in `main`. Missing good coding practices.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The program compiles and runs partially but contains a critical error in using `name.length()`.  C strings don't have a built-in length method. `strlen()` should be used.
    * Logic is otherwise correct in iterating and printing ASCII values.
    * Missing error handling for input buffer overflow in `scanf`.



**Summary:**

* **Total Score:** 13 / 20
* **Percentage:** 65%

**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be matched with reasonable confidence.


**Overall Feedback:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string functions. However, the answers lack precision and depth. The C code has functional errors and lacks good coding practices. The student needs to focus on improving the clarity and completeness of their answers, as well as learning proper C syntax and coding style.  Pay attention to detail!  The student lost many points for small details that were incorrect or missing.
