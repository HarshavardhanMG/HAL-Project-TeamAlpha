## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a basic definition of an algorithm, but it lacked the precision and completeness of the model answer.  The definition missed mentioning "finite set of well-defined instructions," "specific task," and "solve a problem." While the student listed all five characteristics, the explanations were overly simplistic and lacked the depth of the model answer.  Specifically, the explanations didn't fully capture the *importance* of each characteristic as requested.

    * **Definition:** 1.5/2.5
    * **Finiteness:** 1/1.5
    * **Definiteness:** 1/1.5
    * **Input:** 1/1.5
    * **Output:** 1/1.5
    * **Effectiveness:** 1.5/1.5 (This was adequately explained relative to the others)


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct example and a very brief explanation.  The syntax is missing, and the explanation lacks the formal definition present in the model answer.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student provided a correct example and a brief explanation. The syntax is missing, and the explanation lacks the formal definition.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected.  While minor stylistic differences exist compared to the model answer (e.g., prompt phrasing), the core logic and functionality are accurate.


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 16.5 / 20
* **Percentage:** 82.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None

**Areas Where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** The definition of an algorithm was too general. The explanations for the characteristics lacked depth and didn't fully address their importance.
* **Question 2a:** Both parts lacked formal definitions and syntax for the functions.  The explanations were minimal.


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions in C. However, the answers lacked the precision and depth expected in a comprehensive response.  The student should focus on providing more complete definitions, explaining the reasoning behind concepts, and including necessary details like syntax in function explanations. The C program in 2b was well-executed, demonstrating practical coding skills.
