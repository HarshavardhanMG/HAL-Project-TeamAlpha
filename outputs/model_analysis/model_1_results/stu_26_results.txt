## Evaluation of Student's Answers

**Question 1: Define Algorithm. List five important characteristics of an algorithm. Explain the importance of each characteristic.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a reasonable definition of an algorithm, although less formal than the answer key.  The student identified and explained the five characteristics using simpler language, but the core concepts of finiteness, definiteness, input, output, and effectiveness were addressed.  While not using the exact terminology, the explanations demonstrated understanding.  Deducting 0.5 marks for each characteristic for lack of precise terminology and slightly less comprehensive explanations compared to the answer key.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy() - syntax and example**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct example and output. However, the syntax provided was simplified and didn't include the data types, which are important for a complete understanding of the function's signature.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen() - syntax and example**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student provided a correct example and output, but the syntax lacked the return type and the `const` qualifier for the input string.  These details are important for a full understanding of the function.

**Question 2b: C program to output ASCII codes of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:** The student's program functions correctly and produces the desired output. However, the loop implementation is slightly less efficient. Starting the loop from 1 and using `<= strlen(myName)` requires an extra subtraction within the loop (`myName[x-1]`).  While functionally equivalent, it's not the most straightforward approach.  Deducting 1 mark for this less efficient loop implementation.


**Total Score:**

* **Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Awarded Marks:** 15.5
* **Percentage:** 77.5%


**Flagged Responses (None):**

The student's answers, though phrased differently, could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.  No responses require manual review.


**Areas for Improvement:**

* Encourage the student to use precise terminology when defining and explaining algorithmic concepts.
* Emphasize the importance of including complete function signatures (return types, parameter types, and qualifiers) when describing C functions.
* Guide the student towards more efficient and standard loop implementations.


**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses (None):**

All responses were clearly matched based on content.


This detailed evaluation provides specific feedback to the student, highlighting both strengths and areas needing improvement. The breakdown of marks per question offers transparency and helps the student understand the grading process.  The focus on semantic similarity allows for accurate evaluation even when question numbers are missing or incorrect in the student's answers.
