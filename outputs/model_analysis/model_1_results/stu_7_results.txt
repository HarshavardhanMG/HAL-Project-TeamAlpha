## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student's definition is acceptable, although less formal than the answer key.  It captures the core idea of a plan or set of instructions for solving a problem. (2/2.5 marks awarded)
    * Finiteness: Correctly explained. (1.5/1.5 marks awarded)
    * Definiteness: Correctly explained. (1.5/1.5 marks awarded)
    * Input: While correct, the explanation is minimal and lacks the detail of the answer key regarding zero or more inputs. (1/1.5 marks awarded)
    * Output: Correctly explained. (1.5/1.5 marks awarded)
    * Effectiveness: Correctly explained. (1.5/1.5 marks awarded)


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct, concise example. However, they omitted the syntax and a formal definition of the function. The example is functional but lacks explanation.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provided a working example but omitted the syntax and a formal definition.  The example is functional but lacks explanation.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It correctly reads the name, iterates through it, and prints the ASCII values.


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 17
* **Percentage:** 85%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None

**Areas Where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** The definition of an algorithm could be more formal and precise. The explanation of "Input" is too brief.
* **Question 2a:** Both parts are missing formal definitions and syntax explanations. While the examples work, they lack the depth expected in the answer key.  The student focused on practical demonstration rather than complete theoretical explanation.


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a good practical understanding of the concepts, particularly in the programming task. However, they need to improve on providing complete and formal definitions and explanations, especially for theoretical concepts.  The student should focus on including syntax and definitions along with working examples for functions.
