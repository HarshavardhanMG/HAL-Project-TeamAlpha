## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 8.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student provided a good definition of an algorithm, capturing the core concepts. (2.5/2.5)
    * Finiteness:  Explanation is clear and includes the important aspect of avoiding infinite loops. (1.5/1.5)
    * Definiteness: Well explained, emphasizing precision and consistency. (1.5/1.5)
    * Input: Correctly explains that input is optional but necessary for processing data. (1.5/1.5)
    * Output: Clearly states the necessity of at least one output. (1.5/1.5)
    * Effectiveness: While the student mentions limited time and feasibility, the explanation could be more precise by explicitly mentioning that each step should be basic and executable. (1/1.5)


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:**
    * strcpy(): The student explained the function's purpose and provided a correct syntax and a working example. However, the explanation of the syntax could be more formal (using `destination` and `source` instead of just mentioning the order). (2/2.5)
    * strlen(): The explanation is good, including the important detail about excluding the null terminator. The example is correct and functional.  However, the syntax should include the argument type ( `const char *str`). (2/2.5)

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct, efficient, and produces the desired output.  The code is well-formatted and easy to understand. (5/5)


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 17.5
* **Percentage:** 87.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Areas Where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1 (Effectiveness):** The explanation of effectiveness could be improved by explicitly stating that each step should be basic and executable.
* **Question 2a (strcpy() and strlen()):**  The syntax explanations could be more formal and complete. While the examples demonstrate understanding, providing the full syntax is important for demonstrating knowledge of the function signatures.



This evaluation provides a detailed breakdown of the student's performance, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. The student demonstrates a good understanding of algorithms and string handling in C.  Minor improvements in precision and formality would further enhance the answers.
