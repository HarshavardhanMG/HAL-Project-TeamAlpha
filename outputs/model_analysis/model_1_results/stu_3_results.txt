## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provides a reasonable definition of an algorithm, although it lacks the precision of the answer key.  While the student identifies and explains all five characteristics, the explanations are less formal and detailed than the answer key.  Specifically, the explanation of "effectiveness" could be improved by mentioning computational feasibility and time constraints.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student provides a correct, concise explanation and a functional example. However, the syntax is missing, which is a key part of the question.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student provides a correct explanation and example but omits the required syntax.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected.  It correctly reads the name, iterates through the characters, and prints the ASCII values.  Minor variations in prompts ("enter name:" vs. "Enter your name:") are insignificant.

**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 16.5
* **Percentage:** 82.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Detailed Score Breakdown:**

| Question | Max Marks | Awarded Marks | Feedback |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Algorithm Definition & Characteristics | 10 | 7.5 | Definition lacks precision. Explanations of characteristics could be more detailed. |
| 2a(i). strcpy() | 2.5 | 2 | Missing syntax. |
| 2a(ii). strlen() | 2.5 | 2 | Missing syntax. |
| 2b. C Program (ASCII) | 5 | 5 | Correct and functional. |


**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None

**Areas for Improvement:**

* The student should focus on providing more precise and formal definitions, especially for fundamental concepts like algorithms.
* Including the syntax of functions is crucial when asked to explain them.
* While the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts, practicing more formal and detailed explanations would improve their answers.


This evaluation provides a comprehensive assessment of the student's performance, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. The detailed feedback offers specific guidance for the student to enhance their understanding and exam technique.
