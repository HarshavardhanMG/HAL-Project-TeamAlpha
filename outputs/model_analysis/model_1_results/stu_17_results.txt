## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition is simplistic and lacks precision.  Missing key aspects like "well-defined instructions" and the goal of "solving a problem."
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation of importance (1.5/1.5)
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation of importance (1.5/1.5)
    * Input: Correct explanation of importance (1.5/1.5)
    * Output: Correct explanation of importance (1.5/1.5)
    * Effectiveness: Correct explanation of importance (1.5/1.5)


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct example and output.
    * Missing a proper definition of the function's purpose.  The syntax provided lacks the data types (char*).


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 0.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Incorrect example.  Using `char` instead of `char[]` for the string declaration leads to errors. The syntax is also missing the data type.
    * No correct output due to the error in the code.  Only partial credit for recognizing the function's purpose.


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correctly reads the name from the keyboard.
    * Correctly prints the ASCII values of each character.
    * Uses a `while` loop with a null terminator check, which is a valid approach. Minor deduction for not using the more standard `for` loop with `strlen()` as in the answer key.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 13
* **Percentage:** 65%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

None.  All student responses could be matched to the questions based on content.


**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:**

None.


**Areas Where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** The definition of an algorithm is too informal.  The student should be encouraged to use more precise language.
* **Question 2a(i):**  The student needs to provide a complete and accurate function definition and syntax, including data types.
* **Question 2a(ii):** The student's understanding of string declarations in C is flawed, leading to incorrect code. This needs to be addressed.
* **Question 2b:** While the student's solution works, it's slightly less efficient than the model answer.  Introducing the student to different loop constructs and their appropriate usage would be beneficial.


This detailed evaluation provides specific feedback to the student and highlights areas for improvement. The breakdown of marks for each question part allows for a clear understanding of the student's strengths and weaknesses.
