## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). While the student grasps the basic concept, the answer lacks the precision and formality of the reference definition (missing "finite set," "well-defined," etc.).
    * Finiteness: Correct concept, but explanation lacks depth (1/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct concept, but explanation lacks depth (1/1.5).
    * Input: Correct concept and explanation (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct concept and explanation (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Correct concept and explanation (1.5/1.5).

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct example and output.
    * Syntax provided is overly simplified and missing data types (e.g., `char*`).  
    * Missing a proper definition/explanation of the function's purpose.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct example and output.
    * Syntax provided is overly simplified and missing the return type (`size_t`).
    * Missing a proper definition/explanation of the function's purpose.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correctly implements the core functionality and produces the expected output.
    * Uses a `while` loop instead of the more common `for` loop with `strlen()`, but this is functionally equivalent and acceptable.  Slight deduction for not adhering to the most straightforward approach.
    * Prompt for name is slightly different ("Enter your name please:" vs. "Enter your name:"), but this is insignificant.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 14
* **Percentage:** 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Log of Unmatched/Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions.  The C program is functionally correct. However, the answers for the theoretical parts (algorithm definition and function explanations) lack precision and depth. The student should focus on providing more complete and formally correct definitions and explanations.  The code examples, while functional, could be improved by using correct syntax and including more detailed comments.
