## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and List Five Characteristics (10 marks total)**

* **Definition of Algorithm (2.5 marks):**
    * Awarded Marks: 2
    * Feedback: The student provided a reasonable definition, capturing the essential aspects of an algorithm as a step-by-step procedure for solving problems. However, it lacks the precision of the answer key's definition regarding "well-defined instructions" and the emphasis on efficiency and structure.

* **Five Characteristics (1.5 marks each, 7.5 marks total):**
    * **Finiteness:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1.5
        * Feedback:  Correct explanation and importance.
    * **Definiteness:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1.5
        * Feedback: Correct explanation and importance.
    * **Input:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1.5
        * Feedback: Correct explanation and importance.
    * **Output:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1.5
        * Feedback: Correct explanation and importance.
    * **Effectiveness:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1.5
        * Feedback: Correct explanation and importance.


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions (5 marks total)**

* **i. strcpy() (2.5 marks):**
    * Awarded Marks: 2
    * Feedback: The student provided a correct example and explanation of the function. However, the syntax provided is incomplete. It lacks the data types (char*).

* **ii. strlen() (2.5 marks):**
    * Awarded Marks: 2
    * Feedback: The student provided a correct example and explanation of the function. However, the syntax provided is incomplete. It lacks the data type (const char*) and return type (size_t).


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes (5 marks):**

* **C Program (5 marks):**
    * Awarded Marks: 5
    * Feedback: The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It accurately reads the name from the keyboard and outputs the corresponding ASCII values.


**Summary of Scores:**

* **Question 1:** 9 / 10
* **Question 2a:** 4 / 5
* **Question 2b:** 5 / 5
* **Total Score:** 18 / 20
* **Percentage:** 90%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

None.  All responses were matched confidently.


**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:**

None.


**Areas Where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1 (Algorithm Definition):** The definition could be more precise.
* **Question 2a (strcpy() and strlen() Syntax):**  The syntax provided for both functions is incomplete, missing crucial type information.


**Overall Feedback:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of algorithms and their characteristics. The C program for ASCII values is well-written and functional.  Minor improvements are needed in the formal definition of an algorithm and the syntax descriptions for the string functions.  The student achieved a high score, reflecting a solid grasp of the concepts covered in the exam.
