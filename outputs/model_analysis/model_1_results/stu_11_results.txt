## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition is informal and lacks precision.  It doesn't mention key aspects like problem-solving or well-defined steps.
    * Finiteness: Partially correct (1/1.5).  Lacks explanation of why finiteness is important (avoiding infinite loops).
    * Definiteness: Partially correct (1/1.5). Lacks explanation of the importance of clarity and consistency.
    * Input: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Output: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Effectiveness: Partially correct (1/1.5).  The explanation is too simplistic and doesn't mention feasibility or time constraints.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**  Missing syntax and a proper explanation of the function. The example is correct but lacks context.  No mention of `destination` and `source` roles.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Missing syntax and a more detailed explanation of the function (e.g., excluding the null terminator). The example is correct but lacks context.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The program is functionally correct and well-structured. Minor deduction for slightly different prompt ("Enter name:" instead of "Enter your name:").

**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 14
* **Percentage:** 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None.  All answers could be matched to the questions based on content.


**Detailed Log of Matching and Deviations:**

* **Question 1:** Matched based on the keywords "algorithm," "finiteness," "definiteness," "input," "output," and "effectiveness."  The student's answer deviates from the expected answer in terms of formality and depth of explanation.
* **Question 2a(i):** Matched based on the keyword "strcpy()" and the provided C code example. The answer deviates by lacking a formal explanation and syntax.
* **Question 2a(ii):** Matched based on the keyword "strlen()" and the provided C code example. The answer deviates by lacking a formal explanation and syntax.
* **Question 2b:** Matched based on the C code that reads a name and prints ASCII values. The answer is almost identical to the model answer, with a minor deviation in the prompt text.


**Summary of Areas for Improvement:**

The student needs to work on:

* Providing more formal and complete definitions.
* Explaining the reasoning behind the characteristics of algorithms.
* Including proper syntax and detailed explanations for functions.
* Paying attention to the specific wording of prompts in questions.


This detailed evaluation provides a comprehensive understanding of the student's strengths and weaknesses, enabling targeted feedback and improvement.
