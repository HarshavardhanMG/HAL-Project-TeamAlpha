## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a reasonable informal definition of an algorithm. While not as formal as the answer key, it captures the essence.  The explanations for each characteristic are also acceptable, though they lack the level of detail present in the answer key (e.g., mentioning "infinite loop" for Finiteness or "consistent performance" for Definiteness would have strengthened the answer).  -0.5 for the definition and -0.5 for each characteristic explanation.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct example and demonstrated understanding of the function's purpose. However, the formal definition and syntax are missing. -1 for missing definition and syntax.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student provided a correct example and demonstrated understanding.  However, the formal definition and syntax are missing. -1 for missing definition and syntax.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct, functional, and matches the expected output.  No deductions.


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 15.5
* **Percentage:** 77.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Areas Where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** While the student grasped the core concepts of algorithm characteristics, their explanations lacked the precision and completeness of the answer key.  More formal language and specific examples would improve the answers.
* **Question 2a:**  The student omitted the formal definitions and syntax for both `strcpy()` and `strlen()`.  Including these is crucial for demonstrating a complete understanding of these functions.


**General Recommendations for the Student:**

* Focus on providing more formal and complete definitions, especially when asked for them explicitly.
* Pay attention to syntax details when explaining programming functions.
* Elaborate on the reasoning behind each characteristic or concept, providing specific examples where applicable.  This demonstrates a deeper understanding.


This detailed evaluation provides a comprehensive breakdown of the student's performance, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. The specific feedback and recommendations will help the student understand where they lost marks and how to improve their answers in future exams.
