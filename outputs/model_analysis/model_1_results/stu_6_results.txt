## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student provided a simplified definition, missing the key aspects of "well-defined," "finite set," and the goal of "solving a problem."  (-1 mark)
    * Finiteness:  Good explanation with relevant context. (Full marks)
    * Definiteness: The student's explanation focuses on simplicity and ease of understanding rather than precision and unambiguity. (-0.5 marks)
    * Input:  Correct and concise explanation. (Full marks)
    * Output: Correct and concise explanation. (Full marks)
    * Effectiveness: The student's explanation focuses on ease of execution and short time, missing the core concept of feasibility of each step. (-0.5 marks)


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions**

* **i. strcpy()**
    * **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
    * **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
    * **Feedback:** The student provided a correct example but omitted the syntax and a formal definition. (-1 mark)

* **ii. strlen()**
    * **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
    * **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
    * **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student provided a correct example but omitted the syntax and a formal definition. (-1 mark)


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct, functional, and well-structured. It accurately reads the name and outputs the corresponding ASCII values. (Full marks)


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 17
* **Percentage:** 85%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Areas where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1 (Definition):** The definition of an algorithm lacks precision.  The student should be encouraged to use more formal and complete definitions.
* **Question 1 (Definiteness & Effectiveness):** The student's understanding of these characteristics is slightly off.  Further clarification on the difference between simplicity and unambiguity (definiteness) and between ease of execution and feasibility (effectiveness) would be beneficial.
* **Question 2a (strcpy() and strlen()):** While the examples are correct, the student needs to pay attention to providing complete answers, including definitions and syntax, as requested in the question.


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the core concepts, particularly in implementing the C program. However, they need to improve on providing complete and precise definitions and explanations, especially for theoretical concepts.  Focusing on the specific terminology and formal structure expected in technical definitions will significantly enhance their answers.
