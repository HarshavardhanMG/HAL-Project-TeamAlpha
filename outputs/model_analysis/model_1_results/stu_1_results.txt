## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a reasonable definition of an algorithm in layman's terms, although it lacks the formal precision of the answer key.  Full marks awarded for the definition.  While the student identified all five characteristics and explained their importance, the explanations lacked the precise terminology expected in the answer key (e.g., "finite number of steps," "unambiguous").  0.5 marks deducted for each characteristic explanation for lack of precision.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student correctly explained the function of `strcpy()` and provided a working example. However, the explanation lacked the formal definition and the explicit syntax declaration present in the answer key. 0.5 marks deducted for missing formal definition and syntax.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student explained `strlen()` functionally with a correct example.  However, the formal definition and syntax declaration are missing. 0.5 marks deducted for missing formal definition and syntax.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected.  Full marks awarded.


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 16.5
* **Percentage:** 82.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Areas where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** While conceptually correct, the student's explanations of algorithm characteristics lacked the precise terminology expected in the answer key.  More formal language and definitions should be encouraged.
* **Question 2a:**  Both `strcpy()` and `strlen()` explanations missed the formal definitions and syntax declarations.  Emphasis on including these elements in future answers is recommended.


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts.  However, they need to focus on using more precise and formal language, especially when defining technical terms and explaining functions.  Including syntax and formal definitions is crucial for demonstrating a complete understanding.  The student's programming skills are satisfactory, as evidenced by the correct implementation of the C program.
