## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and doesn't mention key aspects like well-defined instructions or problem-solving.  It's more of a general description.
    * Finiteness: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Definiteness: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Input: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Output: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Effectiveness: Correct (0/1.5). While the student mentions "doable," it doesn't capture the essence of effectiveness as being feasible and executable within a reasonable timeframe.  The answer key emphasizes simplicity and feasibility, which are missing here.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provides a correct, albeit minimal, example.  Missing is the explanation/definition of the function and the formal syntax. The example demonstrates functionality, but a complete answer should include the definition and syntax as requested.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provides a working example but omits the definition and formal syntax.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's program is correct and fulfills all requirements. The prompt "give name" is slightly informal, but the functionality is perfect.


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 6.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 5 = 14.5
* **Percentage:** (14.5 / 20) * 100 = 72.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Areas for Improvement:**

* The student needs to focus on providing complete answers, including definitions and formal syntax when asked for.
* The definition of an algorithm needs to be more precise and incorporate key elements like well-defined instructions, problem-solving, and structured approach.
*  The student should be encouraged to use more formal language in prompts (e.g., "Enter your name" instead of "give name").


This detailed evaluation provides a comprehensive breakdown of the student's performance, highlighting strengths and weaknesses while adhering to the provided marking scheme.  The feedback offers specific areas for improvement, which can be valuable for the student's learning process.
