## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a simplified definition of an algorithm, missing the formal aspects of "finite set of well-defined instructions."  While the characteristics are identified correctly and their importance explained adequately, the explanations lack the precision of the answer key (e.g., "finite number of steps," "clear, precise, and unambiguous").  0.5 marks deducted for the definition and 0.5 marks deducted from each characteristic explanation.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a basic example and identified the function's purpose. However, the syntax provided is incomplete (missing data types). The example is functional but lacks the `return 0;` statement and uses `void main()` which is not standard C.  Marks deducted for incomplete syntax and non-standard C usage.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student demonstrated understanding of strlen() with a working example. However, the syntax is incomplete (missing data types) and the example uses `void main()`. Marks deducted for incomplete syntax and non-standard C usage.

**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student's program compiles and runs, but it contains a significant error: using `sizeof(myname)` instead of `strlen(myname)` in the loop condition. This leads to iterating through the entire allocated memory for the array, not just the entered name. The student added a null check, which prevents some garbage output but doesn't address the core issue. Marks awarded for basic functionality and attempting to handle the null terminator, but significant deduction for the incorrect loop condition.


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 18
* **Marks Obtained:** 12.5
* **Percentage:** 69.44%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

None. All responses could be matched to the questions based on content.


**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:**

None.


**Areas Where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** Lack of formal language in defining an algorithm and explaining its characteristics.
* **Question 2a(i) & 2a(ii):** Incomplete syntax and non-standard C usage (`void main()`).
* **Question 2b:** Incorrect loop condition using `sizeof` instead of `strlen`.


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions. However, the answers lack precision and demonstrate some misconceptions in C programming, particularly regarding string handling and array manipulation.  The student needs to focus on using correct syntax, adhering to C standards, and understanding the difference between array size and string length.  Further practice and review of fundamental C concepts are recommended.
