## Evaluation of Student Answers

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a reasonable definition of an algorithm in simpler terms, but it lacks the formal precision of the answer key.  While all five characteristics are mentioned, the explanations for each are less detailed than expected. Specifically, the explanation for "Input" is too brief and doesn't mention the dynamic handling of data.

**Breakdown:**

* Definition: 2/2.5 (Slightly informal definition)
* Finiteness: 1.5/1.5
* Definiteness: 1.5/1.5
* Input: 0.5/1.5 (Insufficient explanation)
* Output: 1.5/1.5
* Effectiveness: 1.5/1.5


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct example and demonstrated understanding of the function's purpose. However, the formal definition and explicit syntax declaration are missing.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student provided a working example, demonstrating understanding. However, the formal definition and syntax are missing.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's program is correct, functional, and matches the expected output.  Good use of `strlen()` within the loop.


## Summary

* **Total Score:** 15.5 / 20
* **Percentage:** 77.5%

## Flagged Responses for Manual Review

None.  All student responses were matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


## Detailed Log of Matching

While the student didn't explicitly label their answers with question numbers, the order of their responses and the content clearly matched the question paper's sequence.  Therefore, matching was straightforward.


## Areas for Improvement in Student Answers

* **Formal Definitions:** The student should practice writing formal definitions for functions and concepts.  While understanding the practical application is important, exams often require precise definitions.
* **Syntax Declarations:**  Including the correct syntax for functions is crucial in programming exams.  The student should make a habit of including these.
* **Elaboration on Characteristics:**  While the student identified the key characteristics of an algorithm, providing more detailed explanations demonstrating deeper understanding would improve their score.  Specifically, expanding on the role of input and its dynamic nature would be beneficial.
