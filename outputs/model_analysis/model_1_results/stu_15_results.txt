## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and doesn't mention the structured nature of algorithms.  While the student grasps the basic idea, it needs more formal phrasing.
    * Finiteness: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Definiteness: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Input: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Output: Correct (1.5/1.5)
    * Effectiveness: Correct (0/1.5). While mentioned, the explanation lacks depth. The student should have elaborated on the feasibility and executability within a reasonable timeframe.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provides a correct, albeit minimal, example. Missing is a proper explanation of the function's purpose and the formal syntax. The example lacks comments and context.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provides a working example but omits the definition, formal syntax, and detailed explanation.  The example lacks comments and context.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The program is functionally correct and achieves the desired outcome. However, the prompt "what is your name" could be slightly more informative (e.g., "Enter your name:"). Minor deduction for less user-friendly prompt.


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Marks:** 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 6.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 4.5 = 14
* **Percentage:** (14/20) * 100 = 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Areas for Improvement:**

* The student needs to focus on providing complete answers, including definitions, syntax, and explanations, along with examples.
* More attention should be given to the clarity and precision of language used in definitions and explanations.
* Code examples should be well-commented and provide context.
* User prompts in programs should be clear and informative.


This detailed evaluation provides a comprehensive breakdown of the student's performance, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. The feedback offered can be used to guide the student towards a better understanding of the concepts and improve their answer presentation in future exams.
