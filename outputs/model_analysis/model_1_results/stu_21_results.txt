## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics (10 marks total)**

* **Definition (2.5 marks):**
    * Awarded Marks: 1.5
    * Feedback: The student provides a basic definition but lacks the precision and completeness of the model answer.  Missing mentions of "well-defined instructions," "specific task," and the importance of being "precise, efficient, and structured."

* **Characteristics (7.5 marks total - 1.5 each):**
    * **Finiteness:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1.5
        * Feedback: Correct explanation and importance.
    * **Definiteness:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1.5
        * Feedback: Correct explanation and importance.
    * **Input:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1
        * Feedback:  While the importance is understood, the explanation lacks the detail of "zero or more inputs."
    * **Output:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1
        * Feedback: Similar to Input, the importance is understood, but the explanation is less precise than the model answer.
    * **Effectiveness:**
        * Awarded Marks: 1.5
        * Feedback: Correct explanation and importance.


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions (5 marks total - 2.5 each)**

* **strcpy() (2.5 marks):**
    * Awarded Marks: 1
    * Feedback: The student provides the basic function of `strcpy()` but the example code has a syntax error (`strcpy(s2 = s1);`). The correct syntax and a working example are missing, resulting in a deduction. The definition also lacks the detail of the model answer.
* **strlen() (2.5 marks):**
    * Awarded Marks: 1.5
    * Feedback: The student provides the basic function of `strlen()` and a correct example. However, the definition lacks the detail of excluding the null character, leading to a partial mark deduction.  Also, using `void main()` is not standard C and should be `int main()`.


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program (5 marks)**

* **Program (5 marks):**
    * Awarded Marks: 3
    * Feedback: The student's program compiles and runs, correctly taking the name as input and printing ASCII values. However, it uses `sizeof(name_input)` in the loop instead of `strlen(name_input)`.  This means it iterates through the entire array, including uninitialized memory, which is incorrect. While the output for "Daniel" appears correct by chance, it would be wrong for longer or shorter names. The lack of a null-terminator check within the loop is also a flaw.


**Summary of Scores:**

* **Question 1:** 7.5 / 10
* **Question 2a:** 2.5 / 5
* **Question 2b:** 3 / 5
* **Total Score:** 13 / 20
* **Percentage:** 65%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

None.  While some answers are incomplete or contain errors, they are clearly related to the intended questions and don't require manual matching.


**Areas for Improvement:**

* The student needs to work on providing more precise and complete definitions, especially for algorithms and string functions.
* Understanding the difference between `sizeof` and `strlen` is crucial for correct string manipulation in C.
* Paying attention to syntax details (like the correct usage of `strcpy`) and standard C practices (like using `int main()`) is important.
*  The student should focus on the importance of null termination in C strings.


This detailed evaluation provides specific feedback to the student, highlighting areas where they excelled and where they need improvement. The breakdown of marks per question and the overall percentage offer a clear picture of their performance.
