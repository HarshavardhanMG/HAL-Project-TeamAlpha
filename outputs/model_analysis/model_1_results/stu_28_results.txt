## Evaluation of Student Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition is simplistic and lacks the precision and structured nature of an algorithm.  Missing mention of "well-defined instructions."
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Input: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: The student used "Possible" instead of "Effectiveness." While the explanation and importance are conceptually close, it lacks the nuance of "feasible" and execution within a limited time (0/1.5).

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct basic functionality description and example.
    * Missing formal definition and return type in syntax explanation.
    * The example lacks `return 0;` and doesn't print using `%s`. While it would technically work, it's not best practice.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct basic functionality description and example.
    * Missing formal definition, return type, and `size_t` in syntax explanation.
    * Example is functional and demonstrates understanding.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The program logic is mostly correct, including input and the loop structure.
    * Critical error: Incorrect method used to get string length (`name.length()` instead of `strlen(name)`). This would cause a compilation error.  This demonstrates a misunderstanding of C string handling.
    * Minor issue:  No error handling for input buffer overflow in `scanf`.


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Score:** 12 / 20
* **Percentage:** 60%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

None.  All responses were clearly matched to the intended questions.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string functions. However, there are gaps in the formal definitions and some inaccuracies in the C code, particularly with string handling. The student needs to review C string functions and best practices, paying particular attention to data types and proper syntax. The concept of algorithm "effectiveness" also needs clarification.
