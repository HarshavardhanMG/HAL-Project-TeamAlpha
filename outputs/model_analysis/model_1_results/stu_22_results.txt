## Evaluation of Student Answers

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 9.5
* **Feedback:** The student's definition of an algorithm is acceptable, although it lacks the emphasis on precision and structure present in the answer key. Full marks awarded for the characteristics and their explanations.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct example and explanation of `strcpy()`. However, the syntax provided is slightly informal (missing data types).  The use of `void main()` is also incorrect; it should be `int main()`.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student's explanation and example are correct, but the syntax lacks data types (`size_t` return type and `const char*` argument). Also, `void main()` should be `int main()`.

**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's program is correct and functions as expected.  The prompt for input is slightly different, but this is insignificant. The code is well-structured and efficient.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 18.5
* **Percentage:** 92.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:** None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Detailed Breakdown and Areas of Deviation:**

* **Question 1:** While the student's definition of an algorithm is functionally correct, it could be improved by incorporating the concepts of precision and structure.  The answer key's definition is more comprehensive.
* **Question 2a:**  The student consistently omitted data types in the syntax declarations for the string functions. This is a minor inaccuracy but should be addressed.  The incorrect use of `void main()` is also a common mistake that should be corrected.


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of algorithms and their characteristics.  The C code for the ASCII program is well-written and functional.  Minor improvements are needed in the formal syntax declarations for string functions and the definition of an algorithm.  The student achieved a high score, reflecting their overall competence in the subject matter.
