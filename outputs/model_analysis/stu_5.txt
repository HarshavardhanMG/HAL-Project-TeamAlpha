question1 answer:
An algorithm is basically a set of steps that we use to solve problems. We use this to tell computers what to do, it has to be in clear language.
Here are five important things that an algorithm should have:

It has to finish. Its should not keep running forever. The process should stop after doing something, and algorithm should not be in a forever loop.

Every step should be clear. There should be no confusion in any steps of the process.

Algorithm may need inputs, it might be 0 or more.

Algorithm must produce some output. This is the goal of the algorithm to produce some final result.

Each steps of algorithm should be something that can be done. It should be simple and it should work.

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy(): copy string to other variable

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char str1[20] = "abc";
char str2[20];
strcpy(str2,str1);
printf("%s",str2);
}


ii. strlen(): length of string

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char str1[20] = "abc";
int len = strlen(str1);
printf("%d",len);
}


b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
char name[50];
int i;
printf("enter your name : ");
scanf("%s",name);
printf("ASCII: \n");
for(i=0;i<strlen(name);i++)
{
printf("%c: %d\n",name[i],name[i]);
}
return 0;
}
