question1 answer:
Algorithim is step by step process to do some thing, It's how computer do something by following instructions.
important parts of an algorithim.

Finiteness: It has to finish.

Definiteness: clear instructions

input: it might have some inputs to use

output: should give some outputs

effectiveness: instructions has to be valid and doable.

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy() is to copy string

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char a[] = "test";
char b[20];
strcpy(b,a);
printf("%s",b);
}


ii. strlen() is to get length

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char a[] = "test";
int l = strlen(a);
printf("%d",l);
}


b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char name[50];
int i;
printf("what is your name: ");
scanf("%s",name);
printf("ASCII code:\n");
for (i =0; i<strlen(name); i++) {
printf("%c: %d\n",name[i],name[i]);
}
return 0;
}
