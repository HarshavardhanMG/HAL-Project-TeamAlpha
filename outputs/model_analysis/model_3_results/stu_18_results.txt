**Evaluation of Student Answers:**

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2 out of 2.5 marks).  It lacks the precision of the reference answer but conveys the core concept.
    * Finiteness: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Input: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Output: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: Correctly explained using the term "do-able" which, in this context, aligns with the concept of feasibility (1.5 marks).  


**Question 2a: Explain `strcpy()` and `strlen()` with examples.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()`: Explanation is correct, but the example code has errors.  `char str1 = "Hello";` is incorrect; it should be `char str1[] = "Hello";`. This error results in a compilation issue. (1.5 out of 2.5 marks)
    * `strlen()`: Explanation is correct, but the example code has a similar error:  `char text = "Computer";` should be `char text[] = "Computer";`. This results in a compilation issue. Also, the syntax provided is missing the data type for the function. (1.5 out of 2.5 marks)


**Question 2b: Write a C program to print ASCII values of a name.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * The program logic is correct, and the example output is correct.
    * However, the code uses an undefined function `length(myname)`. It should be `strlen(myname)`. This is a significant error. (-2 marks)

* None


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of fundamental concepts like algorithms and their characteristics. However, the student needs to improve their C programming skills, specifically in declaring character arrays and using the correct string functions.  The student understood the logic for the programs but made syntax errors that would prevent successful compilation.  The misuse of `length()` instead of `strlen()` indicates a lack of familiarity with standard C library functions.
