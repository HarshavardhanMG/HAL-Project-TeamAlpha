## Evaluation of Student Answers

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2 out of 2.5 marks).  It lacks the precision and formality of the answer key but conveys the basic concept.
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation and importance (1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: The student's explanation focuses on simplicity rather than clarity and unambiguity. Partial credit (1 out of 1.5 marks).  Should emphasize that each step must be clearly defined, leaving no room for interpretation.
    * Input: Correct explanation and importance (1.5 marks).
    * Output: Correct explanation and importance (1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: Correct explanation and importance (1.5 marks).


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions**

* **i. strcpy()**
    * **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
    * **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
    * **Feedback:** The student provided a correct, concise explanation and a functional example. However, the syntax is missing and the example lacks `return 0;`  and proper `printf` usage to exactly match the output in the answer key.  Missing declaration of `string.h` although used. (Deduct 1 mark for missing syntax and slightly incomplete example).

* **ii. strlen()**
    * **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
    * **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
    * **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the explanation is correct and the example works. However, the syntax is missing and the example lacks `return 0;`.  Missing declaration of `string.h` although used. (Deduct 1 mark for missing syntax and slightly incomplete example).  


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The student's program is functionally correct and produces the desired output. However, minor deductions for stylistic issues: Inconsistent use of whitespace around operators and inconsistent capitalization in `printf` statements. (Deduct 0.5 mark for lack of perfect code style.)  `scanf` should ideally use a width specifier to prevent buffer overflow (minor issue).


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 15
* **Percentage:** 75%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Summary:** The student demonstrates a good understanding of the fundamental concepts of algorithms and string handling in C. The answers are mostly correct, but lack the precision and completeness expected in an exam setting.  The student needs to pay more attention to syntax, code style, and providing comprehensive explanations that include all required elements (e.g., syntax in function explanations).  Minor improvements in these areas would significantly improve the overall score.
