## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1/2.5). The definition lacks precision and important details like finiteness and well-defined instructions.  It's too simplistic.
    * Finiteness: Partially correct (0.5/1.5). The student understands the concept but hasn't used appropriate terminology.  "Must stop" is not precise enough.
    * Definiteness: Partially correct (0.5/1.5). Similar to finiteness, understanding is present but the explanation ("Steps clear") lacks precision.
    * Input: Correct (1/1.5).  Slight deduction for lacking the "zero or more" detail.
    * Output: Correct (1/1.5). Similar to Input, slight deduction for not being comprehensive.
    * Effectiveness: Partially correct (0.5/1.5). "Steps doable" is a weak explanation.  It should mention feasibility and efficiency.  


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** 
    * Definition: Missing (0/0.5). No definition of the function's purpose provided.
    * Syntax: Incorrect (0.5/1). Missing data types and the `const` keyword for the source.
    * Example: Correct (1/1). The code compiles and demonstrates the function correctly.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Missing (0/0.5). No definition of the function's purpose is provided.
    * Syntax: Incorrect (0.5/1). Missing data type (size_t) and `const` keyword.
    * Example: Correct (1/1). The code compiles and demonstrates the function correctly.



**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * Functionality: Mostly Correct (2/3). The program outputs the correct ASCII values. However, it uses a do-while loop with an incorrect termination condition ( `username[index] != NULL`). Should use `strlen` for determining the loop's end.  This demonstrates a misunderstanding of string termination in C.
    * Input/Output: Correct (1/1).  Handles input and provides the required output format correctly.
    * Efficiency/Style: Minor Deduction (0/1).  While functional, the chosen loop construct is not ideal and points to a knowledge gap. `for` loop would be more appropriate and efficient. Using `NULL` to compare a character is incorrect; it should be `'\0'`.


**Total Score:**

* **Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Awarded Marks:** 11
* **Percentage:** 55%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be matched with reasonable confidence.


**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string manipulation functions in C. However, their answers lack precision and depth in explaining concepts.  There are significant gaps in understanding the nuances of C string handling, particularly regarding string termination and appropriate loop usage. The student needs to focus on improving their understanding of fundamental concepts and practicing writing more precise and efficient code.  They also need to pay closer attention to syntax details.
