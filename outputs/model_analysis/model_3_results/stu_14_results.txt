## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:** The student provided a very basic definition of an algorithm, lacking precision and key elements like "finite set of well-defined instructions." The explanations for each characteristic were superficial and lacked the depth expected in the answer key.  The student did identify all five characteristics.  More detail on ensuring termination, avoiding ambiguity, the role of inputs in handling variable data, the purpose of outputs as solutions, and the feasibility of execution is needed.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct but minimal explanation of the function's purpose. The example code is functional but lacks the `return 0;` statement and a `printf` statement showing the original string for better clarity and demonstration. Missing formal syntax definition.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the explanation is correct but minimal. The example code functions correctly but  lacks the `return 0;` statement  and a `printf` statement displaying the original string for better context. Missing formal syntax definition.

**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The code functions correctly and fulfills the requirements of the question. Minor deductions for less descriptive prompt ("enter your name" instead of "Enter your name: ") and lack of consistent capitalization/spacing in output ("ascii:" instead of "ASCII values of the entered name:").


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 11.5
* **Percentage:** 57.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be confidently matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Detailed Feedback and Areas for Improvement:**

* **Question 1:**  The student needs to focus on providing a more formal and complete definition of an algorithm.  Understanding and explaining the nuances of each characteristic is crucial. Rote memorization of keywords isn't sufficient; demonstrating comprehension of their implications is essential.
* **Question 2a:** Encourage the student to include formal syntax definitions and improve the clarity of their example code by adding `return 0;` and displaying both input and output for better demonstration.  Explanations, while correct, could benefit from being more comprehensive.  What happens if the destination string is too small? What is the return value of strcpy? What is the data type of the return value of strlen?
* **Question 2b:** Although functional, attention to detail in prompts and output formatting is important for good programming practice.  Consistent use of capitalization and spacing enhances readability.  


This detailed evaluation provides specific feedback to the student, highlighting areas needing improvement and reinforcing correct understanding.  The quantitative scoring offers a clear assessment of performance, while the qualitative feedback guides further learning.
