## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics (Max Marks: 10)**

* **Awarded Marks: 8.5 / 10**
* **Feedback:** The student provided a good definition of an algorithm. The explanations for each characteristic were generally accurate but lacked the specific detail of the answer key, particularly regarding the impact of each characteristic on algorithm design and execution.  Minor deductions for each characteristic explanation.

**Question 2a (i): strcpy() (Max Marks: 2.5)**

* **Awarded Marks: 2 / 2.5**
* **Feedback:** The student correctly explained the function's purpose and provided a working example. However, the syntax provided lacked the data types, making it incomplete. Missing `return 0;` and proper headers in the example (though compiled code was correct so minor deduction.)  

**Question 2a (ii): strlen() (Max Marks: 2.5)**

* **Awarded Marks: 2 / 2.5**
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student explained the function well and gave a working example. However, the syntax was incomplete (missing data type `size_t` and `const char*`). Missing `return 0;` and proper headers in the example (though compiled code was correct so minor deduction.)

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values (Max Marks: 5)**

* **Awarded Marks: 5 / 5**
* **Feedback:** The student wrote a correct and efficient program that met all the requirements of the question. The code is well-formatted and includes clear output.


## Score Summary:

* **Total Awarded Marks: 17.5 / 20**
* **Percentage: 87.5%**


## Flagged Responses for Manual Review:

* **None:** All student responses were confidently matched to the corresponding questions based on content.  While there were minor deductions in 2a for incomplete syntax, the code examples were functional, demonstrating understanding.


## Detailed Score Breakdown:

| Question | Maximum Marks | Awarded Marks | Feedback |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10 | 8.5 | Good definition and explanations of characteristics, but lacking some specific detail from the answer key in the impact of each. |
| 2a (i) | 2.5 | 2 | Correct explanation and working example, but incomplete syntax and minor formatting issues in code. |
| 2a (ii) | 2.5 | 2 | Correct explanation and working example, but incomplete syntax and minor formatting issues in code. |
| 2b | 5 | 5 | Correct and well-written program. |


## Areas for Improvement:

* **Precision in Syntax:** Encourage the student to pay more attention to detail when writing function syntax, including data types.  
* **Depth in Explanations:** While the student understands the concepts, encourage deeper explanations that connect the characteristic of an algorithm to its practical implications in program design and execution (e.g., how finiteness prevents infinite loops, how definiteness ensures consistent results).  This will elevate answers from demonstrating basic understanding to showcasing deeper knowledge.
