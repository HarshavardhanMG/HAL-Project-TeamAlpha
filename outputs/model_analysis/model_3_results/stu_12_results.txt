## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and completeness.  Missing key aspects like "well-defined instructions," "specific task," and "solve a problem."  While the student conveys a basic understanding, it needs more formal language and clarity.
    * Finiteness: Correct understanding, but lacks detailed explanation of consequences (1/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct understanding, but lacks detailed explanation  (1/1.5).
    * Input: Correct but simplistic; needs more elaboration on the role of input (1/1.5).
    * Output: Correct but simplistic; needs more elaboration on its significance (1/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Correct understanding  (1.5/1.5).


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provides a correct code example but lacks a proper definition and formal syntax declaration. Missing explanation of the purpose and behavior of the function.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provides a working code example but misses the formal definition, syntax, and a detailed explanation of the function's purpose.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The code functions correctly and produces the desired output. However, the prompt "give name:" is less informative than the suggested "Enter your name:". Minor deduction for less user-friendly prompt.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 14.5
* **Percentage:** 72.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Detailed Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Areas where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Lack of Formal Definitions:** The student consistently demonstrates understanding through code examples but struggles with providing formal definitions and explanations. This highlights a potential weakness in theoretical understanding versus practical application.
* **Incomplete Explanations:** While core concepts are grasped, the student's answers lack depth and fail to elaborate on the importance and implications of different characteristics (e.g., finiteness, definiteness in algorithms).
* **Informal Language:**  Using informal language like "Algorithm is like instructions..." or "give name"  indicates a need to improve the use of formal academic language and terminology in answering technical questions.  


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string functions in C. However, there's a clear need for improvement in providing complete definitions, detailed explanations, and using formal language. The student excels in practical coding but needs to strengthen their theoretical foundation.
