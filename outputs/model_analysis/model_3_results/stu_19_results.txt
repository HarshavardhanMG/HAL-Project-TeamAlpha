## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics (10 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 9
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct, albeit less detailed, definition of an algorithm. All characteristics were correctly listed with accurate explanations of their importance.  A slightly more comprehensive definition of an algorithm, including the aspects of precision and structured approach, would have earned full marks.  Deducting 1 mark from the definition portion.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function (2.5 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct example and output. However, the syntax provided is missing the data types (char*). The definition lacks the crucial detail of null termination. Deducting 0.5 marks for incomplete syntax and definition.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function (2.5 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct example and output.  However, the syntax is missing the return type (size_t) and the const qualifier for the input string.  The definition lacks the detail of excluding the null terminator from the length count.  Deducting 0.5 marks for incomplete syntax and definition.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values (5 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student attempted the program correctly and understood the logic of printing ASCII values. However, a crucial error was made by using a non-existent function `string_length()` instead of `strlen()`. This resulted in a compilation error.  The program logic and output format (character and its ASCII value) are correct.  Awarding 2 marks for the correct logic and output format. Deducting 3 marks for the compilation error due to incorrect function usage.  


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 15
* **Percentage:** 75%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:**

* None. All responses were clearly matched.


**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Precision in Definitions:** Encourage the student to provide more comprehensive definitions, especially for fundamental concepts like algorithms.
* **Accuracy in Syntax:** Emphasize the importance of including correct data types and qualifiers when defining function syntax.  Understanding the nuances of function signatures is crucial.
* **Standard Library Functions:**  Reinforce the use of standard library functions and discourage the invention of non-standard ones.  Thorough testing and debugging would have revealed the error in 2b.  Encourage consulting C documentation for correct function names and usage.
  
This detailed evaluation provides specific feedback to the student, highlighting areas of strength and weakness. The breakdown of marks for each question allows for a clear understanding of performance. The flagged responses and log sections, though empty in this case, are crucial for ensuring all answers are properly assessed.  Finally, the areas for improvement offer actionable advice for the student's future learning.
