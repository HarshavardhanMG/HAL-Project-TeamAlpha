## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and completeness. Missing key aspects like well-defined, finite set of instructions, specific task, and problem-solving.
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Input: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Correct explanation, but importance could be more specific  (1/1.5).  Saying "possible to execute" is less precise than referencing computational feasibility in a reasonable timeframe.  


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** 
    * Definition: Overly simplified. Missing details about the null terminator and potential buffer overflow issues (0.5/1).
    * Syntax: Incorrect. Missing data types and `const` qualifier for the source (0.5/0.5).
    * Example: Correct functionality, but uses `void main()` which is non-standard. Should use `int main()`. Also missing `return 0;` (1/1).


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Correct but could be more detailed. Could mention it returns the number of characters before the null terminator. (0.5/1)
    * Syntax: Incorrect. Missing data type and `const` qualifier  (0.5/0.5).
    * Example: Correct functionality, but uses `void main()`. Should use `int main()`  Also missing `return 0;`. (1/1).


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correctly reads the name using `scanf`.
    * Correctly iterates through the string using a `while` loop and the null terminator.
    * Correctly prints the ASCII value of each character.
    * Minor deduction for not handling potential buffer overflow with `scanf` (using `scanf("%69s", name_input);`  would be safer). (-0.5)


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 14.5
* **Percentage:** 72.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.  While some question numbers were missing, the context was sufficient.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions. The answers are generally correct in functionality but lack precision and completeness in definitions and explanations. The student needs to improve on adhering to standard C programming practices (e.g., using `int main()`, proper syntax for function declarations, and considering potential buffer overflows).  The student also needs to work on providing more complete and nuanced definitions, instead of relying on overly simplified descriptions.
