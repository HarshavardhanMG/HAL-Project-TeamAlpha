**Evaluation of Student's Answers:**

**Question 1: Define Algorithm. List five important characteristics of an algorithm. Explain the importance of each characteristic.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:** The student provided a simplistic definition of an algorithm, lacking the necessary formality and precision. While the student listed the five characteristics, the explanations lacked depth and clarity.  The definition deserves partial credit (1 out of 2.5). Each characteristic explanation deserves 0.5 out of 1.5 for mentioning the keyword.

**Question 2a. Explain the following string handling functions with examples. i. strcpy() - syntax and example ii. strlen()- syntax and example**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 3 (1.5 for strcpy and 1.5 for strlen)
* **Feedback:**
    * **strcpy():** The student provided a correct example but did not explicitly define the function or provide its formal syntax. Missing definition and syntax (-1 mark).
    * **strlen():** The student provided a correct example but did not explicitly define the function or provide its formal syntax. Missing definition and syntax (-1 mark).


**Question 2b. Write a C program, which reads your name from the keyboard and outputs a list of ASCII codes, which represent your name.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a fully functional and correct C program that meets all the requirements of the question.


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Score:** 12 out of 20
* **Percentage:** 60%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None


**Detailed Score Breakdown:**

| Question Number | Maximum Marks | Awarded Marks | Feedback                                                                                    |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1               | 10            | 4             | Definition lacks precision; explanations of characteristics are superficial.              |
| 2a (strcpy)    | 2.5           | 1.5          | Missing definition and syntax, correct example.                                             |
| 2a (strlen)    | 2.5           | 1.5           | Missing definition and syntax, correct example.                                          |
| 2b              | 5             | 5             | Correct and functional program.                                                             |


**Areas Where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** The student needs to improve their understanding of the formal definition of an algorithm and provide more detailed explanations of its characteristics.  Using more technical vocabulary would be beneficial.
* **Question 2a:** The student needs to practice presenting code solutions more formally, including definitions and syntax alongside examples.  Remembering the specific format requested in the question (definition, syntax, example) is important.  


This detailed evaluation provides specific feedback to the student, highlighting areas for improvement and acknowledging their understanding of program writing.  The numeric scores allow for easy grading and the flagged responses section (empty in this case) ensures that no part of the student's answer is overlooked.
