## Evaluation of Student Answers

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1 out of 2.5). The definition is too simplistic and lacks precision.  Missing key aspects like "well-defined instructions," "finite set," and "solve a problem."
    * Finiteness: Correct characteristic and importance explanation (1.5 out of 1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct characteristic and importance explanation (1.5 out of 1.5).
    * Input: Correct characteristic but importance explanation lacks depth (1 out of 1.5). Should mention the role of input in problem-solving, not just working with data.
    * Output: Correct characteristic but importance explanation lacks depth (1 out of 1.5).  Should mention that the output is the solution to the problem, not just "getting an answer."
    * Effectiveness: The characteristic "Possible" is not the standard terminology.  Should be "Effectiveness" or similar. Importance explanation is weak. (0 out of 1.5)  "Feasible" and relation to computational resources not mentioned.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Oversimplified, lacks detail on the null character termination (1 out of 1).
    * Syntax: Missing return type and `const` qualifier for the source (0.5 out of 1).
    * Example: Correct functionality but lacks proper declaration of `main`  and doesn't print a newline character (0.5 out of 0.5) .  Should be `int main()`.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Correct (1 out of 1).
    * Syntax: Missing return type `size_t` (0.5 out of 1).
    * Example: Correct functionality but lacks proper declaration of `main` (0.5 out of 0.5). Should be `int main()`.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The program logic is mostly correct, including the loop for iterating through the string (2 out of 3).
    * However, there's a critical error in using `name.length()`.  C strings don't have a `length()` method. Should use `strlen(name)`(0 out of 1). This would cause a compilation error.
    *  Missing newline in the `printf` for "Enter name:" which affects readability (0 out of 1).  Input prompt should be clear.

## Overall Feedback

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string functions but lacks precision and depth in their explanations. The C program shows some programming ability but contains a significant error related to string handling in C. The student needs to review fundamental concepts of C programming, especially string manipulation and pay more attention to detail in definitions and syntax.  The student also needs to learn how to write complete and correctly structured C programs, including proper `main` function declarations and appropriate use of input/output functions.
