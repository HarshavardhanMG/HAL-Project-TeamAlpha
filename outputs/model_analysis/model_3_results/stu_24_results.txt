## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrated a good understanding of algorithms and string handling functions. They provided correct code and accurate outputs for both programming tasks.  However, minor deductions are made for missing technical details in the definition of `strcpy` and `strlen`.

**Detailed Score Breakdown:**

**Question 1: Algorithm Definition and Characteristics**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 9.5
* **Feedback:** The definition of the algorithm is good but lacks the crucial component of "solving a problem." It mentions achieving a desired outcome, which is a consequence of problem-solving but not the core purpose.  All characteristics are well explained with accurate importance descriptions.  Deduct 0.5 marks for the incomplete definition.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct code example and output. However, the explanation lacks the crucial detail that `strcpy` copies until the null terminator is encountered in the source string. Also missing is the declaration of `destination` needing enough memory. Deduct 0.5 marks for missing these technical details.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**  The student provided a correct code example and output. However, the syntax provided is incomplete. It should indicate that `strlen` returns a `size_t` value.  The explanation is good, but explicitly mentioning the null terminator ('\0') would enhance clarity. Deduct 0.5 marks for the incomplete syntax and lack of explicit null terminator mention.  

**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct and well-structured C program that accurately reads a name from the keyboard and outputs the corresponding ASCII values. The code is efficient and includes clear output formatting.  No deductions necessary.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 18.5
* **Percentage:** 92.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

None.  All answers were clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Algorithm Definition:** Emphasize the problem-solving aspect of algorithms.
* **`strcpy()` Function:** Include details about null termination and memory allocation requirements for the destination string.
* **`strlen()` Function:** Specify the return type as `size_t` and explicitly mention the null terminator.  Mention potential buffer overflow if using `strcpy` without checking length of the source string.  This may be too advanced for this level, but seeding that concept is valuable.



This detailed evaluation provides specific feedback to the student, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses in their understanding of the concepts. The detailed marking scheme ensures fair and accurate assessment.
