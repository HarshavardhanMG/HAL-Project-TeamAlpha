## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a reasonable definition of an algorithm, although less formal than the answer key.  The explanations for each characteristic are generally correct but lack the specific detail of the answer key regarding the *purpose* of each characteristic  (e.g., finiteness ensures no infinite loops). Specifically, the explanation for "Input" is weak; it needs to state that algorithms can accept zero or more inputs.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student correctly explained the function and provided a working example. However, the syntax provided is incomplete; it lacks the data types ( `char*`).  The example is minimalistic and doesn't showcase potential issues like buffer overflow if the source string is larger than the destination buffer.  

**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student's answer is functionally correct, but the syntax lacks the return type (`size_t`) and the `const` qualifier for the input string. The example is minimalistic.  

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It correctly reads the name, iterates through the characters, and prints the corresponding ASCII values. No issues found.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 16.5
* **Percentage:** 82.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Detailed Score Breakdown:**

| Question | Maximum Marks | Awarded Marks | Feedback |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10 | 7.5 | Definition acceptable but less formal. Explanations for characteristics lack depth, specifically regarding their purpose. Input explanation is weak. |
| 2a(i) | 2.5 | 2 | Functionally correct, but incomplete syntax (missing data types). Minimalistic example. |
| 2a(ii) | 2.5 | 2 | Functionally correct, but incomplete syntax (missing return type and `const`). Minimalistic example. |
| 2b | 5 | 5 | Correct and functional C program. No issues. |


**Overall Comments:** The student demonstrates a good understanding of the fundamental concepts. However, they need to pay more attention to detail, particularly when defining syntax and explaining the nuances of algorithmic characteristics. Providing more comprehensive examples would further strengthen their answers.
