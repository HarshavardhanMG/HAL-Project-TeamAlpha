**Evaluation of Student's Answers:**

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its Characteristics**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student provided a simplified definition of an algorithm, lacking the formality and precision of the reference answer. (1.5/2.5 marks awarded)
    * Finiteness: Correctly explained. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Definiteness: Correctly explained. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Input: Partially correct. While the student acknowledges that an algorithm may or may not have input, they didn't explain the importance of input for handling variable data.  (1/1.5 marks awarded)
    * Output: Correctly explained. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Effectiveness: The explanation lacks the emphasis on feasibility and execution within a limited time frame as mentioned in the reference answer. (0.5/1.5 marks awarded)


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()` : The student provided a minimal explanation and a correct, but very basic, example without explicitly mentioning the syntax or header files. (1.5/2.5 marks awarded)  
    * `strlen()` : Similar to `strcpy()`, the explanation is minimal, lacking a formal definition and syntax declaration. The example is correct. (1.5/2.5 marks awarded)


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a fully functional and correct C program that meets all the requirements of the question.  The code logic, input/output handling, and use of string functions are accurate.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 14.5
* **Percentage:** 72.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and their characteristics but needs to improve the precision and formality of their definitions. While the C program for ASCII code generation is excellent, the explanations and examples for string handling functions lack depth and completeness.  The student should focus on providing more detailed explanations, including formal syntax and definitions, when describing programming concepts.  They should also aim for more comprehensive definitions that capture the key nuances of technical terms like "algorithm."
