## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and Characteristics**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and important elements like "well-defined instructions" and the goal of "solving a problem."  It's more of a layman's explanation.
    * Finiteness: Correct understanding (1.5/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct understanding (1.5/1.5).
    * Input: Correct understanding (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct understanding (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Missing explanation. The student mentions it "should be something that can work," which is vague and doesn't convey the meaning of feasibility and efficiency  (0/1.5).

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**  The student provides a correct example, demonstrating understanding of the function's purpose. However, the explanation lacks a formal definition and the syntax is missing. (1.5/2.5).  Missing proper definition and syntax.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provides a correct example showcasing understanding.  However,  a formal definition and the function's syntax are missing (1.5/2.5). Missing proper definition and syntax.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It reads the name, iterates through each character, and prints the corresponding ASCII value.  Good work!

**Summary:**

* **Total Score:** 15 / 20
* **Percentage:** 75%

**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None.  While some answers are incomplete, they are not ambiguous enough to require manual review.  

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Formal Definitions:** The student needs to practice writing formal definitions for algorithms and functions. Emphasize the importance of including key elements like syntax, purpose, and constraints.
* **Thorough Explanations:** While the student demonstrates understanding through examples, written explanations lacking depth. Encourage the student to elaborate on concepts and provide more detailed reasoning.  For instance, explaining *why* each characteristic of an algorithm is important.
