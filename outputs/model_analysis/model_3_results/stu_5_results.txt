## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student provided a basic definition of an algorithm (1.5 marks awarded). It lacks the precision and completeness of the reference answer, missing key aspects like "well-defined instructions," "specific task," and the importance of structure and efficiency.  (1 mark deducted).
    * Finiteness: The student correctly explained the concept (1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: The student correctly explained the concept (1.5 marks).
    * Input: The student correctly explained the concept (1.5 marks).
    * Output: The student correctly explained the concept (1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness:  The student's explanation lacks the precision of the model answer, specifically the emphasis on feasibility and execution within a limited time. (No marks awarded)


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() Function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a working code example that correctly demonstrates the functionality of `strcpy()` (1.5 marks awarded).
    * However, the student did not provide a definition or a formal syntax explanation  as requested (1 mark deducted).


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() Function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**  Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provided a working code example demonstrating `strlen()`(1.5 marks). However, the definition and formal syntax explanation are missing (1 mark deducted).


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program correctly reads a name from the keyboard, iterates through each character, and prints the corresponding ASCII code.  The program is functional and well-structured.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 15
* **Percentage:** 75%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and their characteristics but needs to improve the precision and completeness of their definitions. While the student can write functional code for string manipulation, they need to pay more attention to providing complete explanations, including definitions and syntax. The student excelled in writing the C program for ASCII code conversion.  Overall, a decent understanding of the concepts is shown, but more focus is needed on theoretical details and formal explanations.
