## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2/2.5 marks). More formal language would be preferred.
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Input: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Output: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: The student's explanation focuses on simplicity and ease, missing the core concept of feasibility and executability in a finite time (0/1.5 marks).  Should have emphasized that each step must be doable by the computing agent.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct but minimal example. Missing a clear definition and the formal syntax of the function. The example works but lacks explanation.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student provided a correct minimal example. Missing a clear definition and the formal syntax of the function.  The example works but lacks explanation.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected.  It correctly reads the name, iterates through the characters, and prints the corresponding ASCII values.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 17
* **Percentage:** 85%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None


**Detailed Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:**

* None - All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Areas where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** The explanation of "Effectiveness" was insufficient.  The student needs to understand the difference between simple/easy and feasible/executable.  
* **Question 2a:** Both explanations for `strcpy()` and `strlen()` lack formal definitions and syntax. While the examples are correct, a complete answer should include these elements.  The student needs to understand the importance of providing complete answers, including definitions, syntax, and well-commented examples.  


**Overall Feedback:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic programming concepts and algorithms. However, they need to improve on providing complete and formal answers, particularly in explaining theoretical concepts and defining functions.  Emphasis should be placed on precision and completeness in answering questions, not just providing working code.
