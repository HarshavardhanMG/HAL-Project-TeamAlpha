question1 answer:
An algorithm is set of rules to solve something. Like how a machine would do a task by following instructions.
things that is important for algorithm

It needs to finish, no endless loops.

Instructions needs to be very clear

Need some sort of input to work on

Should always give output

It should be something that can work.

question2 answer:
a)
i. strcpy() copy string to another string
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char a[20] = "hi";
char b[20];
strcpy(b,a);
printf("%s",b);
}

ii. strlen() gives length of string
Example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
char a[20] = "hi";
int len = strlen(a);
printf("%d",len);
}


b)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
    char name[50];
    int i;
    printf("name is? ");
    scanf("%s",name);
    printf("ascii value\n");
    for(i=0;i<strlen(name);i++)
    {
        printf("%c: %d\n",name[i],name[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
