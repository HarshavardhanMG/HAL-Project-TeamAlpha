## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2 out of 2.5 marks).  Lacks the precision of the reference answer but conveys the core concept.
    * Characteristics:  The student correctly identified all five characteristics and their importance, albeit in a simplified manner. Full marks awarded for each characteristic (1.5 each).  While the explanations lack the detailed language of the answer key, they demonstrate understanding.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a correct example and output.
    * Syntax provided is missing data types and the `const` keyword for the source (deduct 0.5 marks).


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a correct example and output.
    * Syntax provided is missing data types and `const`  (deduct 0.5 marks).  Using `void main()` is also technically incorrect; `int main()` is preferred.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student's program functions correctly and produces the desired output.
    * Minor deduction (0.5 marks) for not explicitly handling potential buffer overflow in the `scanf` function. Using `fgets` would be a more robust approach for reading user input.  While the example output is correct, longer input strings could cause issues.  


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 25
* **Marks Obtained:** 19
* **Percentage:** 76%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be confidently matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the fundamental concepts of algorithms and string handling functions in C.  The answers are generally correct, although some lack the formal language and precision expected in a detailed technical explanation.  The C code is functional but could be improved with better input validation practices.   The student should be encouraged to pay more attention to detail, specifically regarding function syntax and safe coding practices.
