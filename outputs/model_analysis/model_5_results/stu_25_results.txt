## Evaluation of Student Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics (10 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for each characteristic and its importance)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified definition, missing key aspects like finiteness, well-defined instructions, and problem-solving. (1.5/2.5 awarded)
    * Characteristics: While the student listed all characteristics, the explanations of their importance were overly simplistic and lacked depth.  Each characteristic explanation receives 1 / 1.5 marks.  


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions (5 marks)**

* **i. strcpy() (2.5 marks)**
    * **Awarded Marks:** 2
    * **Feedback:** Correct syntax and a working example provided. However, the definition lacks detail (e.g., mentioning null termination, potential buffer overflow). Example lacks comments explaining the code.
* **ii. strlen() (2.5 marks)**
    * **Awarded Marks:** 1
    * **Feedback:** The student incorrectly declared the string variable as `char` instead of `char[]`. This results in a compilation error or warning. The syntax provided is also incomplete (missing data type). The example, due to the incorrect declaration, does not demonstrate the function correctly.


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program (5 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The program functions correctly and produces the desired output. However, using `0` instead of `'\0'` to check for the null terminator, while functionally equivalent in this case, is not good practice and should be explicitly mentioned. Minor deduction for lack of comments explaining the code's logic.  


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 14
* **Percentage:** 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Detailed Log of Deviations:**

* **Question 1:** The definition of the algorithm is incomplete. Explanations of characteristic importance are superficial.
* **Question 2a (strcpy()):**  Missing detailed explanation in the definition about null termination and potential buffer overflow.
* **Question 2a (strlen()):** Incorrect string declaration in the example (`char` instead of `char[]`). Incomplete syntax. The example doesn't demonstrate the function correctly due to the error.
* **Question 2b:** Use of `0` instead of `'\0'` for the null terminator. While functionally correct in this specific context, it's not a recommended practice and could lead to confusion.  Lack of code comments.  


**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions in C. However, the answers lack depth and precision in explanations.  The student needs to pay more attention to detail in code syntax and best practices.  Encouraging the student to write clearer and more detailed explanations, along with properly commented code, would significantly improve their answers.
