## Evaluation of Student Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student provided a simplified definition of an algorithm, missing the key aspects of "well-defined instructions" and problem-solving. (1.5/2.5 awarded)
    * Finiteness:  Correct explanation and importance. (1.5/1.5 awarded)
    * Definiteness: The student's explanation focuses on simplicity rather than precision and unambiguity.  (1/1.5 awarded)
    * Input: Correct explanation. (1.5/1.5 awarded)
    * Output: Correct explanation. (1.5/1.5 awarded)
    * Effectiveness: The student's explanation combines effectiveness with feasibility, missing the core concept of simple and executable steps. (1/1.5 awarded).


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a correct but minimal explanation of the function.
    * The example code is functional but lacks comments and a clear `return 0;` in the provided snippet.  Syntax is correctly presented implicitly within the code.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * Similar to `strcpy()`, the explanation is correct but minimal.
    * The example code is functional but lacks comments and a clear `return 0;` in the provided snippet. Syntax is correctly presented implicitly within the code.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The program functions correctly and produces the desired output.
    * Minor deduction for lack of comments and slightly inconsistent formatting (e.g., `scanf("%s",name);`  should ideally have a space: `scanf("%s", name);`).  Input prompt is less clear than the example ("enter your name" vs "Enter your name:").


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 16
* **Percentage:** 80%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None.  All student responses could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of the core concepts but needs to improve on providing precise definitions and explanations. The programming skills are evident, but attention to detail, such as comments and consistent formatting, is necessary for achieving higher marks.  The student could benefit from focusing on clarity and completeness in their answers.
