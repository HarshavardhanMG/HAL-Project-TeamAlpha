## Evaluation of Student's Answers

Here's a detailed evaluation of the student's answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm. List five important characteristics of an algorithm. Explain the importance of each characteristic.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2/2.5 marks). It lacks the formality of the reference answer but conveys the core concept.
    * Characteristics:
        * Finiteness: Explained correctly with good emphasis on termination and avoiding infinite loops. (1.5/1.5 marks)
        * Definiteness: Well explained using the example of clear instructions and avoiding vagueness.  (1.5/1.5 marks)
        * Input: Correctly explained the concept of input as necessary information for the algorithm. The analogy to ingredients is helpful. (1.5/1.5 marks)
        * Output: Correctly explained as the result or answer produced by the algorithm. (1.5/1.5 marks)
        * Effectiveness: While the core concept of feasibility is addressed, the example of "asking the computer to fly" is weak.  It should have focused on practically executable instructions. (1/1.5 marks)


**Question 2a: Explain the following string handling functions with examples. i. strcpy() ii. strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()` : The explanation is adequate, and the example code is correct and functional. However, it lacks the formal definition and syntax declaration as requested. (2/2.5 marks).
    * `strlen()` : The explanation is good, and the example code correctly demonstrates the function's usage.  However, it lacks the formal definition and syntax declaration as requested. (2/2.5 marks).

**Question 2b: Write a C program to read a name and output its ASCII codes.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct, functional, and well-structured. It accurately reads the name from the keyboard, iterates through each character, and prints the corresponding ASCII value.  No errors found.



**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 16.5
* **Percentage:** 82.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of algorithms and their characteristics. The C program for ASCII code generation is excellent. However, the answers for string functions lack the formal structure expected in an exam, specifically missing syntax declarations and formal definitions.  While the examples are correct, including the formal components is crucial for full marks.  The student should focus on providing more comprehensive and formally structured answers, especially when definitions and syntax are specifically requested.
