## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:** The student provided a very basic definition of an algorithm, lacking the crucial aspects of finiteness, well-defined instructions, and problem-solving.  While the student listed the five characteristics, the explanations were superficial and lacked the depth required to demonstrate understanding of their importance.  The student should provide more detailed explanations for each characteristic, including how they contribute to a functional and efficient algorithm.  For example, for "Definiteness," the student could have explained how ambiguity can lead to errors and inconsistent results.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct but minimal explanation of the `strcpy()` function. The code example is functional but lacks the `printf` statement to demonstrate the copying process explicitly in the output. The student missed providing the syntax of the function, which was explicitly asked for.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5 
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the explanation of `strlen()` is functional but lacks depth.  The student did not provide the function's syntax, which was explicitly asked for in the question.  The code example works correctly but would benefit from a more descriptive `printf` statement clarifying the output.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is almost perfect. It correctly reads the name, iterates through the characters, and prints the ASCII values. Minor deduction for not following best practices:  "enter your name" in the prompt should be "Enter your name: "  (with capitalization and a colon for better readability).


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 11.5
* **Percentage:** 57.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Detailed Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None - All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Areas where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Lack of Depth in Explanations:** The student consistently provided superficial explanations, lacking the detail and precision expected in an exam setting. This was especially evident in the definition and explanation of algorithm characteristics.
* **Missing Syntax:** The student failed to provide the syntax for both `strcpy()` and `strlen()`, even though it was explicitly requested in the question.
* **Minor Programming Style Issues:** While the C program was functionally correct, minor issues like inconsistent capitalization and punctuation in prompts could indicate a lack of attention to detail.


**General Recommendations for the Student:**

* **Focus on understanding concepts deeply:**  Memorizing definitions is not enough. The student needs to understand the underlying principles and be able to explain them in their own words with clarity and precision.
* **Pay attention to detail:** Carefully read the question prompts and ensure all parts are addressed.  This includes providing syntax, complete explanations, and following coding best practices.
* **Practice writing more detailed answers:** The student should practice elaborating on their answers and providing concrete examples to support their points.  This will help them demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
