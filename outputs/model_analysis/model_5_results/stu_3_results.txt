**Evaluation of Student's Answers:**

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its Characteristics**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student's definition of an algorithm is simplistic and lacks precision. It doesn't mention the key aspects of well-defined instructions and problem-solving. (1.5/2.5 marks awarded)
    * Characteristics:  The student correctly identifies all five characteristics and provides a reasonable explanation for each, although some explanations lack the desired level of detail compared to the answer key.  (5 * 1.2 / 7.5 marks awarded)


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() Function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provides a correct definition and a working example. However, the syntax of the function is missing.  The example lacks detailed explanation (e.g. including headers).


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() Function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** 
    * Similar to strcpy(), the student provides a correct definition and a working example, but omits the formal syntax of the function. The example lacks detailed explanation (e.g. including headers, explaining the output).


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII Codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student's program is functionally correct and produces the desired output. However, minor deductions for not using a more descriptive variable name (like `name` instead of `n`) and for slightly less clear prompt message ("enter name:" instead of "Enter your name: ").


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 16
* **Percentage:** 80%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Detailed Log of Matching:**

* All answers were matched confidently based on content.  The order of answers matched the order of questions.  


**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Question 1:** The student should provide a more formal and complete definition of an algorithm, emphasizing its problem-solving nature and the need for well-defined steps.  More detailed explanations of the characteristics would also be beneficial.
* **Question 2a:**  The student needs to include the formal syntax of the `strcpy()` and `strlen()` functions in their answers.  Providing more comprehensive examples with explanations would improve the answer quality.
* **Question 2b:** While the code functions correctly, encouraging better variable names and user prompts would reinforce good programming practices.
