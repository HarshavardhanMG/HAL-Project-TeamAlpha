## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** 
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2/2.5 marks).  It lacks the precision of the answer key but conveys the core concept.
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Input: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Output: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: Partially correct (1/1.5 marks). While the student mentions feasibility, they don't explicitly state the importance of simplicity and efficiency as highlighted in the answer key.  "Reasonable amount of time" is less precise than "limited amount of time."


**Question 2a: Explain `strcpy()` and `strlen()` with examples.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 3.5
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()`: Partially Correct (2/2.5 marks). The student provides a correct definition and a working example. However, the syntax provided is missing the data types, making it incomplete.  The `const` keyword for the source is missing.
    * `strlen()`: Partially Correct (1.5/2.5 marks). The student provides a correct definition and a working example. However, the syntax is overly simplified and misses the return type (`size_t`) and the `const` qualifier for the input string.


**Question 2b: Write a C program to print ASCII values of a name.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It accurately reads the name from the keyboard and prints the corresponding ASCII values.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 16
* **Percentage:** 80%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of algorithms and their characteristics. The C program for ASCII values is correctly implemented. However, there are minor inaccuracies in the explanations and syntax for the string functions `strcpy()` and `strlen()`. The student could benefit from reviewing the formal syntax and including all necessary details in their answers.  The student also needs to refine their understanding of the characteristic of "Effectiveness" in the context of algorithms.
