## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and completeness.  Missing key aspects like "well-defined instructions," "finite set," and "solve a problem."
    * Finiteness: Correct concept, but lacks detailed explanation of its importance (1/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct concept, but lacks detailed explanation of its importance (1/1.5).
    * Input: Correct concept, good explanation (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct concept, good explanation (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Missing.  The student's point about "It should be something that can work" is too vague and doesn't accurately capture the concept of effectiveness as described in the answer key.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct example and basic functionality demonstrated.
    * Missing formal definition and syntax declaration as requested in the question.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct example and basic functionality demonstrated.
    * Missing formal definition and syntax declaration as requested in the question.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct and functional program.
    * Minor stylistic differences (e.g., prompt wording) are acceptable.  The core logic and output are accurate.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 12.5
* **Percentage:** 62.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All responses could be confidently matched to their respective questions based on content.


**Detailed Log of Matching:**

* All answers were matched based on content. While question numbers were missing, the content clearly corresponded to specific questions in the paper.  For example, the discussion of `strcpy` and `strlen` could only pertain to question 2a.


**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Question 1:** The student needs to work on providing more precise and complete definitions. Understanding the nuances of technical terms like "algorithm" and its characteristics is crucial.
* **Question 2a:**  Emphasis should be placed on understanding and explaining the formal syntax and definitions of functions, not just demonstrating their use in code.  This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the function's purpose and how it operates.  


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and C programming concepts. However, there's a need for improvement in providing detailed explanations and formal definitions. The student should focus on understanding the theoretical aspects in addition to practical implementation.
