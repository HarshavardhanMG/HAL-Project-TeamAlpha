## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1:**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a basic definition of an algorithm but lacked the precision and depth of the reference answer.  While the student listed all five characteristics, the explanations were overly simplistic and lacked the crucial details about the importance of each characteristic as outlined in the answer key. Specifically, the explanations lacked depth regarding WHY each characteristic is important.  For example, for "Finiteness," the student simply stated it "must stop after sometime."  The answer key elaborates that this ensures the algorithm doesn't run infinitely and completes in reasonable time.  This level of detail is missing from all characteristic explanations.


**Question 2a (i) - strcpy():**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a functional code example, demonstrating understanding of `strcpy()`. However, the answer lacks a formal definition and the explicit syntax declaration as requested in the question.  Missing the definition and formal syntax loses valuable points.

**Question 2a (ii) - strlen():**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provided a working code example for `strlen()` but omitted the formal definition and the syntax declaration.  Again, missing crucial elements of a complete answer.


**Question 2b - ASCII Program:**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program correctly reads a name from the keyboard and outputs the corresponding ASCII values. The code is functional and well-structured. A minor deduction could be considered for informal prompt ("name please:" instead of something more descriptive).  However, the code functions perfectly and demonstrates clear understanding.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 14
* **Percentage:** 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None.  All responses were clearly matched to their corresponding questions based on content.


**Detailed Feedback Summary:**

The student demonstrated a practical understanding of algorithms and string handling functions in C. However, the answers lacked the theoretical depth and formal structure expected in a detailed examination. The student needs to focus on providing comprehensive definitions, explicitly stating syntax, and elaborating on the "why" behind concepts, not just the "what." The coding skills are evident, but strengthening the theoretical foundation will significantly improve performance.  Pay attention to the specific requirements of each question (definition, syntax, example).  Don't just provide code when a more comprehensive answer is expected.
