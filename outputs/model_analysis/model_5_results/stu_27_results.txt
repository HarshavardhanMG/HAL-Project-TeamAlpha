**Evaluation of Student Answers:**

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics (10 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1 out of 2.5). Definition is too simplistic and lacks precision. Missing key elements like "finite set," "well-defined instructions," "solve a problem."
    * Finiteness: Partially correct (0.5 out of 1.5). Identified the characteristic but the explanation lacks depth regarding preventing infinite loops.
    * Definiteness: Partially correct (0.5 out of 1.5). Identified the characteristic but the explanation is simplistic. Needs more detail on clarity and consistency.  
    * Input: Partially correct (0.5 out of 1.5). Identified the characteristic but explanation lacks sufficient detail on handling variable data.
    * Output: Partially correct (0.5 out of 1.5). Identified the characteristic. Explanation is superficial. Needs to elaborate on representing the solution.
    * Effectiveness: Partially correct (1 out of 1.5).  Understood the concept but needs to mention the importance of feasibility within a limited time.


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions (5 marks)**

* **strcpy()**
    * **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
    * **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
    * **Feedback:** Correct implementation and output. However, the definition and explanation are overly simplistic. Syntax lacks data types (char*).
* **strlen()**
    * **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
    * **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
    * **Feedback:** Correct implementation and output.  Definition and explanation are too brief. Syntax lacks data types (size_t, const char*).  Missing explanation about excluding the null character.

**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program (5 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * The program compiles and runs, correctly printing the ASCII values.
    * Incorrect loop termination condition. Using `username[index] != NULL` is incorrect; it should be `username[index] != '\0'`.  While the code might work in some cases due to how memory is allocated, relying on this is bad practice and could lead to errors. Should use strlen() for determining loop termination.  (-1 mark)
    * `scanf("%s", username);` is vulnerable to buffer overflow. Should use a safer input method like `fgets`. (-1 mark).



**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 9.5
* **Percentage:** 47.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None.  All answers could be matched to questions based on content.  However, the student consistently provided minimal explanations, lacking the depth and precision expected at this level.


**Overall Feedback:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the concepts but consistently fails to provide complete and detailed explanations. The code, while functional in parts, reveals a lack of understanding of important programming practices like proper string termination and safe input handling.  The student needs to focus on improving clarity, precision, and depth in their answers and acquiring a stronger grasp of C programming fundamentals.
