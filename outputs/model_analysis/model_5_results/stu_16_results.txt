## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: 2/2.5  The definition is simplistic but captures the core idea of a plan to solve a problem.  Lacks the precision of the reference answer (finite set of well-defined instructions).
    * Finiteness: 1.5/1.5 Correct explanation and importance.
    * Definiteness: 1.5/1.5 Correct explanation and importance.
    * Input: 1/1.5 The explanation is overly simplified. While correct, it doesn't fully convey the concept of zero or more inputs and their dynamic nature.
    * Output: 1/1.5 Similar to input, the explanation is too basic and misses the nuance of "at least one output."
    * Effectiveness:0.5/1.5 The student's answer ("Steps should be possible to do") is vague. It doesn't explicitly mention feasibility or execution within a limited time.  "Possible" is subjective and doesn't capture the essence of effectiveness in algorithmic context.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct Example and Output: 1  The example code functions correctly and produces the expected output. However, `void main()` is not standard C and should be `int main()`.
    * Syntax: 0.5/1 The syntax provided is missing the data types.  A proper declaration is crucial for understanding function signatures.
    * Definition: 0/0.5 The definition provided is too simplistic. It should mention copying the null terminator as well.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
     * Correct Example and Output: 1 The example code is functional and provides the correct output. However, `void main()` should be `int main()`.
     * Syntax:0.5/1 The syntax lacks the return type (size_t). Accuracy in syntax is important for demonstrating understanding.
     * Definition: 0/0.5 The definition is incomplete. It should mention that the length is calculated excluding the null terminator.


**Question 2b: ASCII code program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct Logic for ASCII Conversion: 2 The core logic of iterating through the string and printing ASCII values is correct.
    * Input and Output: 1 The program correctly takes input and produces the desired output (ASCII values).
    * Incorrect use of `sizeof`: -1 Using `sizeof(myname)` will return the size of the entire array (30), not the length of the entered string. This leads to printing garbage values after the name. Should have used `strlen()`.
    * Unnecessary Null Check: -1 While the null check (`if (myname[i] != '\0')`) doesn't cause harm here, it's redundant because the loop should terminate when the null terminator is encountered.  This demonstrates a slight misunderstanding of string termination in C.



**Total Score:**

* **Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Awarded Marks:** 13/20
* **Percentage:** 65%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions. However, there are significant areas for improvement, particularly in providing precise definitions, adhering to correct C syntax, and understanding the nuances of string manipulation in C.  The student needs to pay closer attention to detail and review fundamental concepts like string termination and the difference between `sizeof` and `strlen`.  The student also needs to use the correct `int main()` function signature.
