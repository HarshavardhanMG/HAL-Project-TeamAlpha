## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2 out of 2.5 marks).  Lacks the precision of the reference answer but conveys the core concept.
    * Finiteness: Explained correctly using simpler language (1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: Explained correctly using simpler language (1.5 marks).
    * Input: Explained correctly using simpler language (1.5 marks).
    * Output: Explained correctly using simpler language (1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: The student used the term "Possible to Do," which captures the essence of effectiveness but lacks the formal terminology. (0 out of 1.5 marks).  Should have used terms like 'feasible' or 'executable'.


**Question 2a: Explain `strcpy()` and `strlen()` with examples.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()`: The student provided a correct explanation, syntax (though less formal), and a working example. (2.5 marks).
    * `strlen()`: The student provided a correct explanation, syntax (though less formal), and a working example. (2.5 marks). Minor deduction for informal syntax presentation - should use `size_t` for return type and `const char*` for the parameter. Awarding full marks due to correct understanding demonstrated in the example. (-0.5 marks, then added back due to correct understanding)


**Question 2b: C program to print ASCII values of name.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:**
    * The student's program functions correctly and produces the desired output. (4 marks).
    * Minor error in the `for` loop: It starts from index 1 instead of 0, although it corrects for it inside the loop by using `myName[x-1]`. This demonstrates understanding but is not the standard practice. (-1 mark).


## Summary:

* **Total Score:** 14.5 out of 20
* **Percentage:** 72.5%

## Flagged Responses for Manual Review:

* None. All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.  While some question numbers were missing, the context was clear.


## Areas for Improvement:

* **Formal Terminology:** The student should be encouraged to use more formal computer science terminology (e.g., "feasible" instead of "possible to do," correct syntax representations).
* **Attention to Detail:**  The student should pay closer attention to details like loop indexing (starting from 0 in C arrays) to avoid minor errors.
* **Formal Definition of Algorithm:** While the student's definition was acceptable, reinforcing the formal definition including terms like "finite set of well-defined instructions" would be beneficial.
