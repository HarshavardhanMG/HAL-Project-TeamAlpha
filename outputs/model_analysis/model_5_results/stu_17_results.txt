## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplistic definition lacking precision. (1 out of 2.5 marks awarded)  Should have included "finite set of well-defined instructions" and the purpose of solving a specific problem.
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation and importance. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation and importance. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Input: Correct explanation and importance. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Output: Correct explanation and importance. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Effectiveness: Correct explanation but the term "effectiveness" is not the best choice. The answer key uses "effectiveness", but "feasibility" or "implementability" would be more accurate.  (1 out of 1.5 marks awarded).


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** Correct syntax and a working example are provided. However, the definition lacks the detail of the answer key (e.g., mentioning null termination or the return value). The use of`void main()` is incorrect; it should be `int main()`.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1
* **Feedback:** The definition is overly simplistic. The syntax is incorrect (missing the data type and `const`). The example has a major error: declaring `char my_string = "example";` instead of `char my_string[] = "example";`. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of string representation in C.  The student correctly identifies that this will cause a compiler error or warning.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The student's code is functionally correct and well-structured. It efficiently uses a `while` loop to iterate through the string. It correctly reads the name using `scanf` and prints the ASCII values. A minor deduction for not explicitly limiting the input string length in `scanf` which could lead to buffer overflow. (Using `fgets` would be safer).


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 14
* **Percentage:** 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and their characteristics but needs to improve the precision of definitions.  The student shows some proficiency in C programming with a good solution for the ASCII program, but needs to solidify understanding of string manipulation functions, particularly concerning correct syntax, data types, and potential errors.  The student should review the difference between character arrays and single characters in C. They should also learn about safer input methods to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
