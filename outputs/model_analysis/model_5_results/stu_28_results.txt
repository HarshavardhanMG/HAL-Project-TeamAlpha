## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and completeness. Missing key aspects like "well-defined instructions" and problem-solving objective.  
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Input: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct explanation and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: The student used "Possible" instead of "Effectiveness". While the explanation and importance are close, it doesn't fully capture the intended meaning of efficiency and feasibility in algorithm design (0/1.5).


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Overly simplified.  Lacks detail about the null terminator and potential buffer overflow issues.
    * Syntax: Missing data types (char*) and the `const` qualifier for the source.
    * Example: Functional but lacks clarity in variable naming (a, b instead of more descriptive names). Missing `return 0;` in `main()`, although this might not cause a compilation error in some compilers.  No `printf` format specifier (should be `printf("%s",b);`).


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Acceptable.
    * Syntax: Incorrect. Missing data type (size_t) and `const char*`.  Parentheses are part of the syntax, not to be confused with mathematical notation.
    * Example: Functional. Missing `return 0;` in `main()`.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The program compiles with a warning but doesn't run correctly due to `name.length()`.  Should use `strlen(name)`. This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of string handling in C.
    * Logically correct approach in using a loop and printing character and ASCII value.  
    * `scanf("%s", name);` is vulnerable to buffer overflow if the user inputs a name longer than 19 characters.  Should ideally use `fgets` for safer input.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 11.5
* **Percentage:** 57.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None.  All answers could be matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and their characteristics but lacks precision in definitions. The student also shows some familiarity with string handling functions in C, but there are significant errors in syntax, understanding of string length calculation in C, and a lack of robust coding practices.  The student needs to review fundamental concepts of C programming, especially string manipulation and input handling.  More attention to detail and precise language are needed when defining computer science concepts.
