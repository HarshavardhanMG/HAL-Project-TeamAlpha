## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Definition and Characteristics of Algorithm**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** 
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified definition, missing key aspects like "well-defined," "finite set," and problem-solving. (1.5/2.5 awarded)
    * Characteristics: While the student identified all five characteristics and their importance, the explanations lack depth and precision.  The explanations are too simplistic and don't fully convey the significance of each characteristic.  (Each characteristic explanation receives 1/1.5)


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a working example and a basic definition. However, the syntax provided is incomplete (missing data types). The use of `void main()` is also incorrect; it should be `int main()`.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provides a working example and a basic definition. However, the syntax is incomplete (missing data type and `const`). The use of `void main()` is incorrect; it should be `int main()`.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student's program is correct and functions as expected. It correctly reads the name, iterates through each character, and prints the corresponding ASCII value.  Good use of a `while` loop and the null terminator check.  


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 17
* **Percentage:** 85%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None


**Detailed Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:**

* None. All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Areas where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** The definition of the algorithm lacks precision. Explanations of characteristics are superficial.
* **Question 2a:** Syntax for both `strcpy()` and `strlen()` is incomplete and lacks necessary detail.  Incorrect usage of `void main()`.


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions in C. However, the answers lack precision and depth in explaining fundamental concepts. The student should focus on providing more comprehensive definitions and explanations, paying attention to detail in syntax and standard coding practices. The programming skills are evident in the correctly implemented solution for Question 2b.
