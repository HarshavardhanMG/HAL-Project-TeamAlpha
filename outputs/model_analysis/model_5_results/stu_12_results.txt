## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and important elements like "well-defined instructions" and the goal of "solving a problem."  While the student conveys the basic idea, it's not a complete definition.
    * Finiteness: Correct concept, but explanation lacks detail about avoiding infinite loops (1/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct concept, but explanation could be more precise (1/1.5).  Using terms like "unambiguous" would strengthen the answer.
    * Input: Correct concept (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct concept (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Correct concept, but the explanation could be improved by mentioning feasibility and time constraints explicitly (1/1.5).


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provides a correct code example demonstrating the function's usage. However, they lack a proper definition and explanation of the function's purpose. The syntax is missing.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
     * The student provides a correct code example demonstrating the function's usage. However, they lack a proper definition and explanation of the function's purpose. The syntax is missing.  The return type (size_t) should be mentioned.


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student provides a fully functional and correct C program that meets all the requirements of the question. The code is well-structured and efficient.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 15
* **Percentage:** 75%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.  While some answers were less precise, there was no ambiguity in determining which question they attempted to answer.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and their characteristics, but needs to work on providing more precise and complete definitions and explanations. The student shows good programming skills in C, successfully implementing the required program for ASCII conversion. However, the student's understanding of string functions needs improvement, specifically in providing definitions, syntax, and detailed explanations beyond code examples.  Overall, the student shows promising practical skills but needs to strengthen their theoretical understanding and ability to articulate concepts clearly.
