## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a rudimentary definition of an algorithm, missing the key aspects of well-defined instructions and problem-solving. While the characteristics were listed, the explanations lacked depth and precision compared to the answer key.  The definition deserves 1 point out of 2.5. Each characteristic explanation deserves 1 point out of 1.5.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct but minimal code example demonstrating `strcpy()`.  Missing is a clear definition and explanation of the function's purpose, as well as a proper declaration of the function's syntax as requested. The code example is functional and deserves 1.5 marks.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student demonstrated `strlen()` with a correct but minimal code example. A definition, explanation of purpose, and formal syntax declaration are missing. The code example is functional and deserves 1.5 marks.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII codes of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is functionally correct and fulfills the requirements of the question. Minor deduction for slightly less clear prompt ("what is your name" instead of "Enter your name"). The logic and output are correct, demonstrating a good understanding of string manipulation and ASCII values.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 14
* **Percentage:** 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be confidently matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Detailed Log of Matching:**

* Question 1: Matched based on keywords "algorithm," "finiteness," "definiteness," "input," "output," "effectiveness."  The student's structuring of the answer clearly corresponds to the multi-part nature of the question.
* Question 2a(i): Matched based on code example using `strcpy()` function.
* Question 2a(ii): Matched based on code example using `strlen()` function.
* Question 2b: Matched based on the C code including `scanf()` for input, loop for iteration, and `printf()` for ASCII output.  The prompt for a name clearly links this code to the question's requirements.


**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Question 1:** The student needs to work on providing more comprehensive definitions and explanations, going beyond simple bullet points. Deeper understanding of core concepts is crucial.
* **Question 2a:** Emphasize the importance of providing clear definitions, explaining the purpose of functions, and including formal syntax declarations alongside code examples.  While the code demonstrates understanding, a complete answer requires more formal structure.  


This detailed evaluation provides a clear breakdown of the student's performance, highlighting strengths and weaknesses while offering specific feedback for improvement.  The use of semantic matching allows for accurate assessment even with the lack of explicit question numbers in the student's answer.
