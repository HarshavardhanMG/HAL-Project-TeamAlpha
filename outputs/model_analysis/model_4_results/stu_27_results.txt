## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1/2.5). The definition lacks precision and doesn't mention key aspects like well-defined instructions and problem-solving.  
    * Finiteness: Partially correct (0.5/1.5). The importance is overly simplified.
    * Definiteness: Partially correct (0.5/1.5). The importance is overly simplified.
    * Input: Partially correct (0.5/1.5). The importance is overly simplified.
    * Output: Partially correct (0.5/1.5). The importance is overly simplified.
    * Effectiveness: Partially correct (0.5/1.5). The importance is overly simplified.  The student uses "doable" which is not the formal terminology.  Should be "feasible".


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Missing.
    * Syntax: Incorrect (0/0.5). Missing data types and `const`.
    * Example: Correct functionality (1/1), but lacks explanation (0.5/1).


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Missing.
    * Syntax: Incorrect (0/0.5). Missing data type and `const`.
    * Example: Correct functionality (1/1), but lacks explanation (0.5/1).


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * Correctly reads name and prints ASCII values (3/4).
    * Incorrect loop termination condition. Using `username[index] != NULL` is incorrect; it should be `username[index] != '\0'` to check for the null terminator (0/1).  While the code happens to work in this instance, it's relying on undefined behavior and is not guaranteed to work correctly.  Deducting 1 mark for the incorrect logic.



**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 10
* **Percentage:** 50%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string functions but lacks precision and depth in their explanations. The C program for ASCII values is functional but contains a critical error in the loop termination condition, highlighting a misunderstanding of string termination in C. The student needs to focus on improving the clarity and completeness of their answers and pay closer attention to the details of syntax and core concepts.  The student also needs to learn to use more precise and formal language in their explanations.
