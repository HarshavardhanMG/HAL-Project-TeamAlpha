## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:** The student provided a very simplistic definition of an algorithm, lacking the necessary formality and precision. While the student listed the five characteristics, the explanations were extremely brief and lacked depth.  The importance of each characteristic was not explained.  More detail is needed to demonstrate understanding.  For example, for Finiteness, the student should have mentioned the consequence of not having this characteristic (infinite loops).  Similar detailed explanations were missing for other characteristics as well.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a basic example demonstrating the functionality of `strcpy()`, but did not provide the syntax or a formal definition. The example is minimalistic and lacks context (e.g., explaining the purpose of including header files).

**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provided a working example for `strlen()` but omitted the syntax and a proper definition.  The example lacks context and explanation.

**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is functionally correct and accomplishes the task of printing ASCII values of the entered name. However, error handling (e.g., handling input longer than the buffer size) is missing. Minor deductions for lack of comments explaining the code logic.  Input prompt could be more descriptive (e.g., "Enter your name (up to 49 characters):").


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 11.5
* **Percentage:** 57.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Detailed Log of Responses:**

* All responses were matched based on the content of the answers.  While question numbers were missing in the student's answer sheet, the context of each response clearly indicated which question it attempted to answer.


**Areas where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Lack of Formal Definitions:** The student consistently avoided providing formal definitions for algorithm and the C functions.
* **Insufficient Explanations:** Explanations for the characteristics of algorithms and the functionality of C functions were overly simplistic and lacked the required depth.
* **Lack of Context in Code Examples:** Code examples were minimalistic and lacked context, making it difficult to assess the student's understanding of the underlying concepts.
* **Missing Error Handling and Comments in Code:** The C program, while functionally correct, lacked robust error handling and comments to explain the code logic.  


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the concepts but struggles with providing formal definitions, detailed explanations, and robust code. The student needs to focus on improving their theoretical understanding and developing better programming practices, including error handling and documentation.
