## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** 
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2/2.5 marks).  It lacks the precision of the answer key but conveys the core concept.
    * Finiteness: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Input: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Output: Correct explanation (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: The student's answer focuses on feasibility for the machine but doesn't explicitly mention simplicity or efficiency as the answer key does. (1/1.5 marks).  


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a correct, concise definition and a functional example. However, the explanation lacks the formal definition using `const char*` for the source, and the declaration of `char b[20]` could be more explicitly linked to the size of the copied string. (-0.5 marks for missing details in syntax and explanation)


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a correct definition and a functional example. However, the syntax provided is overly simplified and lacks the return type (`size_t`). The example is correct but could be improved with a more descriptive variable name than 'a'. (-0.5 marks for missing details in syntax and less clear explanation)


**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It correctly reads the name, iterates through the characters, and prints the ASCII values.  No errors found.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 16.5
* **Percentage:** 82.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of algorithms and their characteristics, although some refinement is needed in the formal definitions. The student's programming skills are evident in the correct implementation of the C program. Minor deductions were made for lacking precision in describing the syntax and certain details in the string functions.  The student could benefit from focusing on the formal aspects of definitions and syntax in addition to the practical understanding demonstrated.
