## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm. List five important characteristics of an algorithm. Explain the importance of each characteristic.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a basic definition of an algorithm, lacking the precision and completeness of the reference answer.  While the student listed all five characteristics and their importance, the explanations were overly simplistic and lacked the depth of the reference answer.  Specifically, the explanation for "effectiveness" should have emphasized feasibility and efficiency in terms of computational resources.  The definition of an algorithm should mention the well-defined nature of instructions and the goal of solving a specific problem.

**Question 2a(i): Explain strcpy() with syntax and example.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a working example and correctly identified the function's purpose. However, the syntax provided was incomplete (missing data types and the `const` qualifier for the source). The definition lacked detail about potential buffer overflow issues if the destination buffer is smaller than the source. `void main()` is also incorrect; it should be `int main()`.

**Question 2a(ii): Explain strlen() with syntax and example.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**  The student provided a working example and correctly identified the function's purpose. However, the syntax was incomplete (missing data type and `const` qualifier). The definition lacked detail about the null terminator and how the length is calculated up to but not including it. `void main()` is also incorrect; it should be `int main()`.


**Question 2b: Write a C program to read a name and output its ASCII codes.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The student's program functions correctly and produces the desired output. The code is well-structured and uses a `while` loop effectively to iterate through the string. However, using `scanf("%s", name_input);` without specifying a field width is vulnerable to buffer overflow if the user inputs a name longer than the buffer size.  A better approach would be to use `fgets` to limit input.  Minor deduction for not explicitly handling potential input errors.


**Total Score:**

* **Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Awarded Marks:** 14
* **Percentage:** 70%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None


**Summary:** The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions in C. However, the answers lack precision and depth in explaining concepts. The code, while functional, needs improvement in terms of robustness and adherence to best practices (e.g., preventing buffer overflow).  The student should focus on providing more complete definitions and explanations, paying attention to details like syntax, data types, and potential error handling.  The student should also learn about safer input methods like `fgets`.
