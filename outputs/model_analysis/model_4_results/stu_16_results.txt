## Evaluation of Student Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: 1.5/2.5  The definition is overly simplistic and lacks precision. It doesn't mention key aspects like well-defined instructions, finiteness, or problem-solving.  
    * Finiteness: 1.5/1.5 Correct explanation and importance.
    * Definiteness: 1.5/1.5 Correct explanation and importance.
    * Input: 1/1.5 While the importance is correctly stated, the explanation lacks the detail of "zero or more" inputs.
    * Output: 1/1.5 Similar to Input, the "at least one output" detail is missing.
    * Effectiveness: 0.5/1.5 The student used "possible to do" which is less precise than "feasible" and doesn't convey the concept of efficiency within a limited time.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The definition is too brief. It lacks details about the source and destination being null-terminated strings.
    * The syntax is missing the data types (char*).
    * The example is functional but uses `void main()` which is not standard C. `int main()` should be used.  No explanation of the code provided.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The definition is too brief and lacks the crucial detail about excluding the null terminator in the length calculation.
    * The syntax is missing the return type (size_t) and the const qualifier for the input string.
    * The example is functional but uses `void main()`. Should use `int main()`. No explanation of the code provided.



**Question 2b: ASCII code program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The program compiles and runs, but it uses `sizeof(myname)` incorrectly in the loop condition. This will iterate over the entire size of the array (30 bytes), not just the entered name.
    * The student added a null check within the loop, which is a good attempt to avoid printing garbage values, but the fundamental `sizeof` error remains.  This leads to printing extra zeros.
    * Should use `strlen` to determine the length of the entered string.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 11.5
* **Percentage:** 57.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None. All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Overall Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string functions but lacks precision and depth in their explanations.  The coding examples, while functional in some cases, reveal a lack of understanding of crucial concepts like proper C syntax (`int main`, data types in function declarations) and string handling in C (using `sizeof` vs. `strlen`). The student needs to review these fundamental concepts for a stronger understanding.
