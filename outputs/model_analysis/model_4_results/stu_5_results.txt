## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student provided a basic definition of an algorithm (1.5/2.5 marks). It lacks the precision and formality of the reference answer, missing key aspects like "finite set" and "well-defined instructions."
    * Finiteness: The student correctly explained the concept (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: The explanation is adequate, emphasizing clarity (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Input: Correctly explained (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Output: Correctly explained (1.5/1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: The explanation is acceptable but could be more precise by using terms like "feasible" and relating it to computational complexity (1/1.5 marks).  The answer uses simpler language but misses the nuance of "feasible" in terms of computational resources.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct but minimal code example demonstrating the function.  Missing is a clear definition and explanation of the function's purpose (copying the content of one string to another), as well as a formal declaration of the syntax. The example lacks comments and context.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provides a working code example but lacks a proper definition, explanation of the function's purpose (calculating the length of a string), and a formal syntax declaration.  The example lacks comments and context.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It correctly reads the name, iterates through each character, and prints the corresponding ASCII value. Good use of `strlen()` within the loop.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 15
* **Percentage:** 75%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and their characteristics but needs to improve the precision and formality of their definitions.  While the student can write functional C code for string manipulation, they need to focus on providing complete explanations, including definitions, syntax, and purpose, rather than just code examples.  The C program for ASCII conversion is well-executed.  Overall, the student shows promising programming skills but needs to work on theoretical understanding and providing comprehensive explanations.
