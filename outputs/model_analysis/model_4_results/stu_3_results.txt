**Evaluation of Student's Answers:**

**Question 1: Algorithm Definition and Characteristics**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: The student provided a basic definition of an algorithm but lacked the precision and formality of the reference answer.  (-1 mark)  It should mention "well-defined instructions," "finite set," and solving a "problem."
    * Characteristics: The student correctly identified and explained all five characteristics, demonstrating a good understanding of the core concepts.  While the explanations were less detailed than the answer key, the core ideas were present.  (No marks deducted for brevity if the core concept is clear).


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() Function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * The student provided a correct but minimal explanation of the `strcpy()` function. (-0.5 marks for missing a formal definition)
    * The example code is functional and demonstrates the correct usage of `strcpy()`. However, it lacks comments and could be improved with a more descriptive variable name for 'a' (e.g., sourceString). (No marks deducted for this as the code functions correctly).  Best practice should be encouraged in feedback to the student.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() Function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * Similar to `strcpy()`, the explanation is correct but lacks a formal definition. (-0.5 marks for missing formal definition - "excluding the null character")
    * The example code is functional and correctly demonstrates the use of `strlen()`. Again, comments and more descriptive variable names would improve the code quality. (No marks deducted).


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:**
    * The student's C program is correct and efficiently implements the required functionality.
    * The code is well-structured, includes necessary headers, and uses `strlen()` correctly within the loop.
    * Minor improvements could include using a more descriptive variable name for 'n' (e.g., userName) and adding comments.  (No marks deducted as the code is fully functional).


**Total Score and Percentage:**

* **Total Score:** 21.5 / 25
* **Percentage:** 86%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a good understanding of algorithms and their characteristics. The student also exhibits competency in basic C programming, including string manipulation and ASCII code conversion.  While the answers could benefit from greater formality and detail in some areas (especially definitions), the core concepts are well understood. Encourage the student to pay attention to detail, provide more formal definitions, and adopt good coding practices (comments, descriptive variable names) for improved code readability and maintainability.
