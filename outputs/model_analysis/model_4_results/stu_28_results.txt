## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and important elements like "well-defined instructions" and the goal of "solving a problem."  While the analogy to a procedure is helpful, it's not a formal definition.
    * Finiteness: Correct understanding and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct understanding and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Input: Correct understanding and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct understanding and importance (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: The student used "Possible" instead of "Effectiveness." While the core idea of feasibility is conveyed, the specific term and its nuance are missed (0/1.5).  The answer lacks the precision of "simple and feasible steps" and the connection to execution time.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Overly simplified. Missing details about the null terminator and potential buffer overflow issues.
    * Syntax: Missing data types and `const` qualifier for the source.
    * Example: Functional but lacks best practices (e.g., checking return value, ensuring destination buffer size). `printf(b)` is not the recommended way to print a string. `printf("%s", b)` is preferred.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Correct but lacks detail about excluding the null terminator.
    * Syntax: Missing data type and `const` qualifier.  Using "string" instead of  "*str" is incorrect.
    * Example: Functional but lacks best practices (e.g., using `size_t` for the length variable).


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * The program logic is mostly correct. It correctly reads the name and iterates through the characters.
    * **Major Error:** Using `name.length()` is incorrect in C.  C strings do not have a built-in length method. `strlen(name)` should be used. This results in a compilation error.  This demonstrates a lack of understanding of C strings.
    * Minor Issue: Missing error handling for `scanf` (e.g., checking the return value).


**Total Score:**

* **Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Awarded Marks:** 13
* **Percentage:** 65%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All answers could be matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string functions but lacks precision and depth in their explanations. The C program shows promise but contains a significant error related to string handling in C. The student needs to focus on precise definitions, proper syntax, and adhering to C programming conventions.  More practice with C string manipulation is strongly recommended.  The student also needs to pay closer attention to the specific terminology used in the course material (e.g., "Effectiveness" vs. "Possible").
