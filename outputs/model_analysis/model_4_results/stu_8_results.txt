**Evaluation of Student's Answers:**

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics (10 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified definition, lacking the precision of the answer key. (1 mark awarded instead of 2.5)
    * Finiteness: Explained correctly using simpler language. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Definiteness: Explained correctly using simpler language. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Input: Correctly mentioned the possibility of zero or more inputs. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Output: Correct explanation. (1.5 marks awarded)
    * Effectiveness: The student's explanation lacks the emphasis on feasibility and execution in a limited time. (0.5 marks awarded instead of 1.5).  Should have focused on the practicality and efficiency of each step, not just understandability.


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions (5 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for strcpy() + 2.5 for strlen())
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()`: Provided a basic example but lacked a proper definition and syntax explanation as requested. (1.5 marks awarded instead of 2.5)
    * `strlen()`: Provided a basic example but lacked a proper definition and syntax explanation as requested. (1.5 marks awarded instead of 2.5)  Missing explicit mention of excluding the null character in the length calculation.


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program (5 marks)**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It accurately reads a name from the keyboard and outputs the corresponding ASCII values.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 14.5
* **Percentage:** 72.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None

**Detailed Log of Unmatched or Ambiguously Matched Responses:** None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Areas Where Student Answers Deviate from Expected Solutions:**

* **Question 1:** The definition of an algorithm lacked formality and precision. The explanation of "effectiveness" was insufficiently detailed.
* **Question 2a:**  Both `strcpy()` and `strlen()` answers lacked formal definitions and syntax explanations. Relying solely on examples is not sufficient for a complete answer.  


**Overall Assessment:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions. However, the answers lack the required level of detail and formality, especially in definitions and explanations. The student should focus on providing comprehensive answers that include definitions, syntax (where applicable), examples, and clear explanations of concepts.  The programming portion of the exam was answered correctly, showcasing practical coding skills.
