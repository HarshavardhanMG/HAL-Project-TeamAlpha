## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 9.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a good definition of an algorithm and correctly explained all five characteristics with their importance. However, the definition could be slightly more formal.  While using simpler terms like "plan" helps with understanding,  incorporating terms like "finite set of instructions" or "solving a problem" would strengthen the answer.  Minor deduction for lack of complete formal definition.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2.5
* **Feedback:** The student correctly explained the function, provided the correct syntax, and included a working example with the correct output.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2.5
* **Feedback:** The student correctly explained the function, provided the correct syntax, and included a working example with the correct output.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student wrote a correct and efficient C program that reads a name from the keyboard and prints the ASCII values of each character. The code is well-formatted and includes clear output. Using the null terminator in the loop condition (`name_input[i] != '\0'`) is a good practice.

**Detailed Score Breakdown:**

| Question | Maximum Marks | Awarded Marks | Feedback |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10 | 9.5 | Definition could be more formal. Otherwise excellent. |
| 2a(i) | 2.5 | 2.5 | Perfect answer. |
| 2a(ii) | 2.5 | 2.5 | Perfect answer. |
| 2b | 5 | 5 | Perfect answer.  Good use of null terminator in loop condition. |


**Overall Comments:**

The student demonstrated a strong understanding of algorithms and string handling functions in C. The answers were well-structured, clear, and accurate. The C program was correctly implemented and demonstrated good coding practices.  The minor deduction in Question 1 is for lacking the full formality expected in a technical definition, but the overall understanding is clearly present.  Excellent work!
