## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 8.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a good definition of an algorithm in simple terms. The explanations for each characteristic were also accurate, demonstrating understanding. However, the explanation for 'Finiteness' unnecessarily emphasized the "danger" of infinite loops, creating a slightly exaggerated tone.  The explanation for 'Input' could be improved by explicitly mentioning that algorithms transform inputs into outputs.  Minor deductions for these less precise explanations.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student correctly explained the function and provided a working example. However, the syntax provided lacked the data types (char*), making it incomplete.  Deduction for incomplete syntax.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** Similar to strcpy(), the student explained the function well and provided a correct example.  However, the syntax lacked the return type (size_t) and the const qualifier for the input string. Deduction for incomplete syntax.  While the example functions, best practice would include `return 0;` in the `main` function. This was not penalized in this case.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student wrote a correct and efficient program that accurately fulfills all requirements of the question.  The code is well-formatted and easy to understand.


## Score Summary:

* **Total Score:** 23 / 25
* **Percentage:** 92%

## Flagged Responses for Manual Review:

* None. All answers were clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


## Detailed Log of Matching:

* All answers were easily matched to their corresponding questions due to the clear structure of the student's answer and the specific keywords used (e.g., "strcpy()", "strlen()", "Finiteness", "ASCII").


## Areas for Improvement in Student's Answers:

* **Precision in Explanations:** While the student demonstrated understanding, refining the explanations for 'Finiteness' and 'Input' in Question 1 would enhance clarity and accuracy.
* **Complete Syntax:** Paying closer attention to detail when writing function syntax, including data types and qualifiers, is crucial for demonstrating a thorough understanding of the functions.  While the student's examples compiled and ran correctly, the syntax descriptions were incomplete.  This could lead to problems in more complex scenarios.  
* **Code Comments:**  While the student's code for 2b was functional and clear, adding comments to explain the purpose of different code sections would improve readability and demonstrate a deeper understanding of programming practices.  This was not required by the question and thus not penalized.
