## Evaluation of Student's Answers

**Question 1: Define Algorithm. List five important characteristics of an algorithm. Explain the importance of each characteristic.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm. While the characteristics were correctly identified, the explanations lacked the precision and depth of the answer key.  Specifically, the explanation for "finiteness" was well done, but explanations for other characteristics could be improved with more formal language and deeper insight.  For example, "definiteness" could be explained in terms of removing ambiguity in each step's interpretation.  "Effectiveness" could be linked to the practicality and feasibility of each step's execution.

**Question 2a(i): Explain strcpy() with syntax and example.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** The student correctly explained the function of `strcpy()` and provided a working example. However, the formal syntax declaration `char* strcpy(char *destination, const char *source);` is missing.  The explanation could also benefit from mentioning potential buffer overflow issues if the destination buffer is smaller than the source.

**Question 2a(ii): Explain strlen() with syntax and example.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**  The student correctly explained the function of `strlen()` and provided a working example. However, the formal syntax declaration `size_t strlen(const char *str);` is missing. The explanation is good but could be slightly more precise by explicitly stating that the null terminator is not counted.

**Question 2b: Write a C program to read a name and output its ASCII codes.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct and functional C program that meets all the requirements of the question.  The code is well-formatted and efficient.


## Summary

* **Total Score:** 16.5 / 20
* **Percentage:** 82.5%

## Flagged Responses for Manual Review

None.  All answers could be confidently matched to their corresponding questions based on content.


## Areas for Improvement in Student's Answers

* **Formal Definitions and Syntax:** The student should practice writing formal definitions and including syntax declarations for functions.
* **Precision in Explanations:** While the student demonstrates understanding, answers could be strengthened with more precise language and deeper explanations, particularly when describing algorithm characteristics.
* **Considering Edge Cases:**  For functions like `strcpy()`, discussing potential issues like buffer overflow demonstrates a more comprehensive understanding.  


This detailed evaluation provides a comprehensive breakdown of the student's performance, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. The feedback offers specific areas for improvement, enabling the student to better understand the expected level of detail and rigor in their responses.
