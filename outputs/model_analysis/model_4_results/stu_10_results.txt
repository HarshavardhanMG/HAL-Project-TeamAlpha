## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and doesn't mention key aspects like well-defined instructions, problem-solving, and structured approach.  It's too simplistic.
    * Finiteness: Partially correct (1/1.5). Explanation lacks the crucial aspect of completing in a reasonable time.
    * Definiteness: Partially correct (1/1.5).  Explanation lacks the aspect of ensuring consistent performance.
    * Input: Correct (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Incorrect (0/1.5). "Valid task" is not a sufficient explanation. The answer should mention feasibility and execution within a limited time.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The code example is correct and functional, demonstrating understanding. However, there's no explanation of the function's purpose (copying content from source to destination) or a proper definition of its syntax  (`char* strcpy(char *destination, const char *source);`). Missing `return 0;` in the code, but given the focus on string manipulation, this minor omission is not heavily penalized.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The code example is correct and functional. However, there's no explanation of the function's purpose (calculating the length excluding the null character) or a proper definition of its syntax (`size_t strlen(const char *str);`). Missing `return 0;` in the code, but given the focus on string manipulation, this minor omission is not heavily penalized.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The code is correct, functional, and well-structured. It correctly reads the name, iterates through each character, and prints the corresponding ASCII value.  The prompt "name please:" is acceptable.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 17.5
* **Marks Obtained:** 13
* **Percentage:** 74.29%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and string handling functions in C. However, the answers lack depth and precision, particularly in explaining the theoretical concepts. The student excels in the practical programming tasks, providing functional code for both `strcpy()`, `strlen()`, and the ASCII value program.  The student needs to focus on improving their understanding of the theoretical foundations and providing more comprehensive explanations.  More detailed answers with specific terminology would significantly improve the scores.
