## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition lacks precision and completeness. It doesn't mention the finite set of instructions or the problem-solving aspect clearly.  
    * Finiteness: Correct understanding but explanation lacks depth (1/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct understanding but explanation lacks depth (1/1.5).
    * Input: Correct understanding and explanation (1.5/1.5).
    * Output: Correct understanding and explanation (1.5/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Correct understanding but used the term "doable" instead of feasible. Explanation is acceptable (1.5/1.5).

**Question 2a(i): strcpy()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:**
    * Correct syntax and example.
    * Missing a detailed definition of the function's purpose and behavior.  `void main()` is incorrect; should be `int main()`.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen()**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1
* **Feedback:**
    * Syntax is incomplete. Missing `size_t` return type and `const char *str` parameter type.
    * Example code has a critical error: `char my_string = "example";` should be `char my_string[] = "example";`. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of string representation in C.  `void main()` is incorrect; should be `int main()`.  No explanation of the function's purpose.

**Question 2b: C Program for ASCII values**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The program functions correctly and produces the desired output.
    * Minor deduction for not using `fgets` for safer input handling (potential buffer overflow with `scanf`).  Good use of a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop.

**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and their characteristics but lacks precision in definitions. The student shows some proficiency in C programming with string functions but needs to improve their understanding of string handling and function definitions.  The student's solution to the ASCII program is functional but could be improved with safer input methods.  The student lost points primarily due to lack of detail in explanations and some errors in the code examples for string functions.  The student should review data types in C (specifically strings) and ensure proper function definitions are used. They should also focus on providing more comprehensive explanations of concepts.
