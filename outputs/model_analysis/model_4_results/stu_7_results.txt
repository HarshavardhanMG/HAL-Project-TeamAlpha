**Evaluation of Student's Answers:**

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Student provided a simplified but acceptable definition of an algorithm (2 out of 2.5 marks).  It lacks the precision and formality of the answer key but conveys the core concept.
    * Finiteness: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Definiteness: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Input: While the student acknowledges the importance of input, the explanation lacks the clarity of the answer key regarding zero or more inputs (1 out of 1.5 marks).
    * Output: Correctly explained (1.5 marks).
    * Effectiveness: The student's explanation focuses on simplicity rather than feasibility, missing the nuance of executability in a limited time (0.5 out of 1.5 marks).  "Easily doable" is subjective and not as precise as "feasible."


**Question 2a: String Handling Functions**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5 (2.5 for each function)
* **Awarded Marks:** 3
* **Feedback:**
    * `strcpy()` : The student provided a very basic explanation and a minimally functional example. Missing a clear definition, syntax declaration, and a more comprehensive example (1 out of 2.5 marks).  No mention of potential buffer overflow issues.
    * `strlen()` : Similar to `strcpy()`, the explanation is minimal.  Missing a clear definition, syntax declaration, and a more robust example (1 out of 2.5 marks).


**Question 2b: ASCII Code Program**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is correct and functions as expected. It accurately reads the name and prints the corresponding ASCII values.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Maximum Marks:** 20
* **Total Awarded Marks:** 14.5
* **Percentage:** 72.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None.  All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Summary:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and their characteristics but needs to improve the precision and depth of their explanations. The student's understanding of string handling functions is superficial, lacking formal definitions and comprehensive examples. However, the student successfully implemented the C program for ASCII code conversion.  The student should focus on providing more complete and formal answers, especially when explaining technical concepts.  More detailed examples for `strcpy()` and `strlen()` demonstrating edge cases and error handling would significantly improve the answer.  For algorithm characteristics, emphasizing the "why" behind each characteristic would elevate the answer.
