## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm. List five important characteristics of an algorithm. Explain the importance of each characteristic.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 7.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a good analogy for understanding algorithms but lacked a formal definition. The characteristics were explained using relatable examples, demonstrating understanding, but lacked the precise terminology expected (e.g., "It should stop" instead of "Finiteness").  While the explanations conveyed the general meaning, using the correct terms is crucial for demonstrating a deeper understanding of the subject matter.  Full marks awarded for the explanations of the characteristics, but the definition lost marks for lacking formality.

**Question 2a(i): Explain strcpy() with syntax and example.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student correctly explained the function of `strcpy()` and provided the correct output. However, the syntax provided was overly simplified and lacked the data types.  The example code had a syntax error: `char str1 = "Hello";` should be `char str1[] = "Hello";`.  This demonstrates a partial understanding but highlights a lack of precision in syntax.

**Question 2a(ii): Explain strlen() with syntax and example.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:**  Similar to `strcpy()`, the student explained the function of `strlen()` correctly and produced the correct output. However, the syntax provided was incomplete, missing the data type and the `const` qualifier for the input string. The example code also contained a syntax error: `char text = "Computer";` should be `char text[] = "Computer";`. Partial credit awarded for understanding the function but points deducted for inaccuracies in syntax and the example.

**Question 2b: Write a C program to read a name and output its ASCII codes.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:** The student's program functions correctly and produces the desired output. However, the code uses an undefined function `length(myname)` instead of the standard `strlen(myname)`. This indicates a minor error that affects code correctness in a general context, but in this specific case, the compiler might interpret it as a valid function call due to implicit declarations.  Marks deducted for not using the standard library function and potential portability issues.


**Summary:**

* **Total Score:** 15 out of 20
* **Percentage:** 75%

**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**

* None. All responses could be confidently matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Overall Feedback:**

The student demonstrates a good general understanding of the concepts but needs to improve on precision and formal terminology, especially when dealing with syntax and definitions. The student should focus on using the correct terms and conventions in programming and pay closer attention to detail when writing code.  The student's reliance on potentially compiler-specific behavior (implicit declaration of `length`) should be addressed to ensure code portability and correctness.
