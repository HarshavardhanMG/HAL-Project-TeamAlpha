## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 6.5
* **Feedback:**
    * Definition: Partially correct (1.5/2.5). The definition is too simplistic and lacks crucial details like well-defined instructions, finiteness, and the goal of solving a specific problem.
    * Finiteness: Correct characteristic and importance, but explanation lacks depth (1/1.5).
    * Definiteness: Correct characteristic and importance, but explanation lacks depth (1/1.5).
    * Input: Correct characteristic and importance, but explanation lacks depth (1/1.5).
    * Output: Correct characteristic and importance, but explanation lacks depth (1/1.5).
    * Effectiveness: Correct characteristic and importance, but explanation lacks depth (1/1.5).  The term "doable steps" is not as precise as "feasible" or explaining that operations must be executable in a finite amount of time.


**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 2
* **Feedback:** 
    * Correct syntax and a working example provided.
    * Missing a formal definition of the function's purpose (copying the null terminator is an important detail).  The example lacks `return 0;` but this is minor in this context.


**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1
* **Feedback:**
    * Incorrect syntax (missing `const char *`  and using just `string`).
    * The example has a major error: `char text = "short";` should be `char text[] = "short";`. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of string representation in C.  The code would compile with warnings but produce incorrect results.  
    * No correct output provided, acknowledging the error is positive.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII codes**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:**
    * The program functions correctly and produces the desired output.
    * Using `0` instead of `'\0'` to check for the null terminator is technically correct because the ASCII value of the null terminator is 0. However, using `'\0'` is the standard and more readable practice. Minor deduction for lack of best practice ( -0.5 marks).



## Summary:

* **Total Score:** 14 / 20
* **Percentage:** 70%

## Flagged Responses for Manual Review:

* None. All questions were answered and could be matched with reasonable confidence.


## Overall Comments:

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of algorithms and C string functions. However, the answers lack depth and precision, especially in explaining the characteristics of algorithms and defining the `strcpy()` function fully. The error in the `strlen()` example reveals a significant misunderstanding of string handling in C.  While the ASCII code program works, adhering to common coding conventions (using '\0') would improve code clarity and maintainability.  The student needs to focus on providing more detailed explanations and understanding the fundamental concepts more thoroughly.
