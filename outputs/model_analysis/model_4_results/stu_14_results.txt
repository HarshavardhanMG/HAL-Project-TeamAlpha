## Evaluation of Student's Answers:

**Question 1: Define Algorithm and its characteristics.**

* **Maximum Marks:** 10 (2.5 for definition + 5 * 1.5 for characteristics)
* **Awarded Marks:** 4
* **Feedback:** The student provided a very basic definition of an algorithm, lacking the necessary formality and precision. While the five characteristics are listed, the explanations for their importance are superficial and lack depth.  The definition lacks key elements like "finite set" and "well-defined instructions."  Explanations for characteristics are too brief to demonstrate understanding.

**Question 2a(i): strcpy() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** The student provided a correct code example demonstrating the functionality of `strcpy()`. However, the syntax and a formal definition of the function are missing.  Missing syntax explanation and formal definition lose marks.

**Question 2a(ii): strlen() function**

* **Maximum Marks:** 2.5
* **Awarded Marks:** 1.5
* **Feedback:** Similar to `strcpy()`, the student provided a working code example for `strlen()`. However, the syntax and a formal definition are missing, resulting in point deduction. Missing syntax explanation and formal definition lose marks.


**Question 2b: C program for ASCII values of name**

* **Maximum Marks:** 5
* **Awarded Marks:** 4.5
* **Feedback:** The student's C program is functionally correct and accomplishes the task of printing ASCII values for the entered name. However, minor deductions are made for less-than-ideal coding style (e.g., prompt message could be clearer: "enter your name" vs "Enter your name: "). Minor deduction for lack of clarity in user prompt.


**Total Score:**

* **Total Marks:** 20
* **Marks Obtained:** 11.5
* **Percentage:** 57.5%


**Flagged Responses for Manual Review:**  None. All answers could be clearly matched to the corresponding questions based on content.


**Detailed Score Breakdown:**

| Question | Maximum Marks | Awarded Marks | Feedback |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10 | 4 | Definition lacks precision; explanations for characteristics are superficial. |
| 2a(i) | 2.5 | 1.5 | Missing syntax and formal definition; code example is correct. |
| 2a(ii) | 2.5 | 1.5 | Missing syntax and formal definition; code example is correct. |
| 2b | 5 | 4.5 | Functionally correct program; minor deduction for unclear prompt. |


**Overall Comments:**

The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the concepts but lacks the ability to articulate them formally and completely.  The student can write functional code but needs to improve on providing complete explanations including syntax and definitions. More attention should be paid to detail and precision in both theoretical explanations and coding practices.  Encouraging the student to review definitions and formal language related to algorithms and programming concepts would be beneficial.
